      "content": "Dogs are descendents of wolves that roamed wild over much of the world in ancient times. People have associated with dogs for thousands of years, originally domesticating them as beasts of burden and guard animals. Today, there are still many working breeds, and the service roles of dogs have greatly expanded to include assisting disabled individuals (for example, those with visual or hearing impairments), working with human law enforcement by sniffing out illegal drugs and other contraband, locating survivors in search-and-rescue missions, and even using their incredible sense of smell for early detection of cancer cells in human patients. Of course, the primary role of most dogs is that of loyal companion."

They have a heart and circulatory system to transport blood, lungs to take in oxygen and rid the body of carbon dioxide, a digestive tract to absorb nutrients from food, and so on. However, it is the differences between dogs and people that are most interesting and that give dogs their unique characteristics as family members.",

        "title": "Body Size",
        "content": "Dogs come in many shapes and sizes. The smallest breeds include the toy and miniature varieties, such as the Toy Poodle, Papillon, Chihuahua, and Shih Tzu. These dogs usually weigh only 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kilograms), or even less. Medium-sized dogs include many of the terriers and spaniels, which weigh in the 10 to 50 pound (4.5 to 23 kilograms) range. Larger still are the retrievers, shepherds, and setters, which often weigh 65 to 100 pounds (30 to 45 kilograms). Finally, the giant breeds, such as the Mastiff, Komondor, and Saint Bernard, can approach or exceed 200 pounds (91 kilograms). Of course, sizes vary within breeds, with males usually being larger than females. Mixed-breed dogs include all size ranges."

        "title": "Metabolism",
        "content": "Dogs have a higher metabolism than people. They breathe faster, pump blood faster, mature faster, and have a higher normal body temperature ( see Table: Normal Canine Physiologic Values). Young dogs seem to have even more energy than children. However, this high metabolism comes with a shorter life span. A common rule of thumb is that 1 dog year equals about 10 to 12 people years for the first 2 years, and then 4 people years (per dog year) after that ( see Table: Dog Years versus People Years). Actual life span depends on health and size, with small breeds generally living longer than larger ones.",
        "Temperature Regulation": {
          "title": "Temperature Regulation",
          "content": "Dogs are generally much better at conserving heat than at cooling themselves. In sled dogs, who can survive outdoors even in bitterly cold temperatures, the fur acts as an insulating “blanket” that retains the heat generated by the dog’s high metabolism. However, in hot or humid weather, most dogs have difficulty. Dogs cannot sweat, which is an effective form of evaporative cooling. Instead, dogs lose heat primarily by panting. These rapid breaths (10 times faster than normal) are an attempt to lose heat through evaporation by moving hot, moisture-filled air in and out. During the short, shallow breaths in panting, little air can be exchanged in the lungs. In fact, dogs must stop panting periodically to take a good respiratory breath. Drinking water also helps dogs cool down, and the canine hair coat helps insulate from the sun.\nBecause the cooling system of dogs is relatively poor, certain summer situations can be dangerous and even life threatening. Sadly, many dogs die of heat stroke every year ( see What to Do at the Scene and How to Transport). The most common problem is associated with being shut in a parked car. Even with the windows rolled down, the inside of a parked car can quickly reach 150°F (66°C) or more in the summer, which can cause heat stroke and death in a matter of minutes. Other dangerous situations involve being penned or tied out in the sun (without access to shade) or being locked in a poorly ventilated travel crate.\nWays to keep dogs cool during hot weather include air conditioning, spray misters, shade, dips in a wading pool, or gentle spraying with a garden hose. Keeping dogs wet during the heat of the day provides a method of evaporative cooling. Plenty of cool, fresh drinking water should be available at all times."

          "title": "Sight",
          "content": "Dogs can see movement and light much better than people. In the retina of the eye, dogs have more of a specific type of cell called a rod, which is good at collecting dim light, so they have better night vision. A reflective layer in the dog’s eye, called the tapetum lucidum, magnifies incoming light. This reflective layer lends a characteristic blue or greenish glint to dogs’ eyes when light (for example, headlights of passing cars) shines into them at night. However, dogs do not have as much visual acuity as people, meaning that they cannot distinguish fine details as well. They also cannot differentiate colors as well because they have fewer of the cells in the retina called cones, which are responsible for color vision. Contrary to popular belief, however, dogs are not completely colorblind.\nA unique feature of the dog eye is the nictitating membrane, which is also called the third eyelid. This additional eyelid is a whitish pink color, and it is found under the other eyelids in the inside corner (near the nose) of the eye. The third eyelid extends up when needed to protect the eyeball from scratches (for example, while traveling through brush) or in response to inflammation."

          "content": "The ear canal of the dog is much deeper than that of people and creates a better funnel to carry sound to the ear drum. The average dog can hear about 4 times better than the average person, including sounds at higher frequencies than can be detected by the human ear. Dogs are also better at distinguishing the direction of a sound, which is an adaptation useful for hunting. Unfortunately, this deeper ear canal predisposes dogs to ear problems. Grease, wax, and moisture can build up in the ear, leading to inflammation and infection. Floppy ears or hair within the ears further limit ventilation, making matters worse. This is why many dogs need frequent preventive ear cleaning."

        "Smell and Taste": {
          "title": "Smell and Taste",
          "content": "Dogs have an extraordinarily acute sense of smell; it is about a million times more sensitive than that of people. They can detect odors at extremely low levels and can distinguish odors that are subtly different. This is why dogs are able to sniff out drugs and explosives at airports, search for human victims at disaster sites (including victims deep under water), and follow the scent track of criminals.\nOdor molecules dissolve in the moisture that coats the inside of the canine nose. Signals are then sent from the olfactory membranes in the nose to the olfactory center of the brain, which is 40 times bigger in dogs than in people.\nDogs also have an organ on the roof of the mouth that allows them to “taste” certain smells. As in people, taste and smell in dogs are closely linked. However, dogs gain much more information about food from smell than from taste. Dogs have only about one sixth the number of taste buds that people do, and their distinct sense of taste is actually quite poor."

        "content": "Dogs have most of the same muscles, tendons, joints, and ligaments as people. All 4 of the dog’s limbs are maximized for locomotion, from a steady walk to a rapid sprint. In many respects, dogs run like horses, and have the same 4 gaits: walk, trot, canter, and gallop. The canine bones that are comparable to the long bones of our hands and feet are located in the dog’s lower legs. The angular hock in the hind legs is comparable to the ankle in people. Most dogs can swim, although some breeds specifically developed for swimming (for example, retrievers) can swim better than others (such as Bulldogs).",
        "Pads and Nails": {
          "title": "Pads and Nails",
          "content": "The canine paw contains specialized structures that help the dog move over different surfaces. The bottom of the paw is covered by thick, resilient pads that become callused after years of steady wear in direct contact with the ground. These pads protect the paw and help provide a secure grip on many types of surfaces. The toenails help provide traction while running and are also used for digging. Canine toenails are thick, brittle structures made up of a protein called keratin (just like hair). A large blood supply runs down the middle and feeds the cuticle (or “quick”) of the growing nail. Avoiding these blood vessels when trimming toenails can be difficult, especially when the nails are dark. Regardless, keeping nails trimmed is important because nails that snag or break during running or jumping can cause considerable bleeding and pain. Broken nails should be examined by a veterinarian, who can trim away the fractured part of the nail, treat the wound to stop any bleeding, and prevent infection. Dogs have rudimentary equivalents of human thumbs called dew claws that are found on the middle side of the front paws or lower front legs. Dew claws have no function, but they commonly snag and break. Dew claws should also be trimmed periodically to prevent snagging and to keep them from curling around and growing into the foot. They are commonly removed in very young puppies or as an additional surgical procedure when dogs are spayed or neutered."

      "Skin and Hair": {
        "title": "Skin and Hair",
        "content": "Canine skin has several layers, including an outer epidermis that is constantly being replaced and an inner dermis that contains nerves and blood vessels. Canine skin is thinner and much more sensitive than human skin. Dogs should be bathed only with shampoos made specifically for pets. Shampoos and other topical products for people can be irritating to canine skin and should be avoided.\nCanine fur grows from hair follicles in the skin. Dogs have compound hair follicles, with a central (guard) hair surrounded by 3 to 15 secondary hairs growing out of the same pore. Sebaceous (oil) glands within the skin lubricate the hair, keeping the coat shiny and water resistant. Hair growth is controlled by several factors, including nutrition, hormones, and time of year. In general, dogs shed at a slow steady rate all year round, with periods of increased shedding in the spring and fall. Shedding replaces hair gradually, without bald patches (which can be a sign of illness and should be investigated).\nThe main functions of the hair coat are to protect the skin and to help regulate temperature. Fur traps air, which provides a layer of insulation against the cold. Small muscles attached to the guard hairs allow dogs to raise these hairs, which improves air trapping. Dogs also raise their hackles as a threatening gesture in response to danger.\nDifferent breeds of dogs have different types of hair coats. Breeds from northern climates (such as Huskies and Malamutes) have a soft, downy undercoat that provides better insulation in cold weather. Water breeds (retrievers, for example) have more long and stiff guard hairs to protect the skin and undercoat from harsh environmental conditions. Water breeds also have ample oil secretions to lubricate the hair. Breeds from warmer climates have shorter coats designed only to shade the skin. Poodles have very fine, curly hair that sheds far less than that of other breeds."

They have 28 deciduous (baby) teeth that are replaced by 42 permanent (adult) teeth between 2 and 7 months of age ( see Table: Canine Adult Dentition). The different types of teeth have specialized functions, depending on their position in the mouth. The front teeth, which include the 12 incisors and 4 large canine teeth (eye teeth), are designed for grasping and tearing. The rearward premolar and molar teeth grind food into smaller pieces that can be swallowed.\nThe mouth also contains the salivary glands, which secrete saliva that lubricates the food and begins digestion. The tongue helps guide food to the back of the throat and is important for licking up small food pieces and lapping up water. Dogs also lick as a sign of affection or subservience, or both."

      "Digestive and Urinary Tracts": {
        "title": "Digestive and Urinary Tracts",
        "content": "The gastrointestinal tract includes the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine (colon). This system digests food into useful nutrients, absorbs water, and eliminates waste. Digestive problems often show up as vomiting or diarrhea, which can have many causes, including viral infections; worms; stress; or ingestion of bones, sticks, or other foreign material.\nThe urinary system eliminates nitrogenous wastes from protein breakdown and helps control fluid levels. Waste products are filtered by the kidneys and then sent through the ureters to the urinary bladder for storage. Urine is passed out of the body through the urethra. In males, the urethra doubles as a channel for sperm during copulation. Urinary infections are much more common in females and usually show up as frequent dribbles of urine that may be tinged with blood.\nBoth urinary and digestive problems are often associated with straining while urinating or defecating. At first glance, it may be difficult for dog owners to tell the source of the problem. Therefore, it is important to watch your dog while it eliminates and to note the character and color of the urine and feces. Your veterinarian may request a sample of the urine or feces, or both. Diarrhea usually consists of frequent, soft or runny feces that may be a different color (often yellow, gray, or black) than usual. Any sign of blood in the feces calls for veterinary attention. Repeated, unproductive attempts to pass a bowel movement can be a sign of serious constipation or bowel obstruction, which can be an emergency. Prompt veterinary attention is needed if the dog has a tense, painful abdomen or is passing only small amounts of bloody, gel-like feces.",
        "Anal Glands": {
          "title": "Anal Glands",
          "content": "Rump rubbing or “scooting” is usually associated with impacted anal glands, although it can be confused with a digestive problem. The anal glands are located in a layer of muscle at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions around the anus. These scent glands contain a foul-smelling secretion that is normally expressed during a bowel movement. The secretions often thicken, which can plug the duct, causing pressure and irritation that can lead to infection. Many dogs need to have their anal glands manually emptied by their veterinarian on a regular schedule."

The large variety of breeds means that dogs come in all sizes, shapes, and colors, and have a range of temperaments. Many dog breeds have been developed for specific purposes and behaviors. A mismatch can result in unnecessary stress and lead to behavioral problems, which can be difficult to correct.",

        "title": "Size, Activity, and Temperament",
        "content": "Size, activity level, temperament, and breed characteristics (including hair coat) should be considered in choosing a dog. Your dog will live with you for many years, so you must consider how these factors will best fit your lifestyle and situation. For example, large dogs (such as retrievers) and very active dogs (Jack Russell Terriers, for example) need room to run and play. These active dogs do better when they have access to a fenced yard for regular exercise and may not be the best choice for a city dweller who lives in a small apartment. Some dogs, such as Border Collies, appear to have a need to work (for example, herd), or they often become bored and out of sorts. Keep in mind that size is not always a good indicator of activity level. Many small dogs require significant amounts of exercise and attention, while some large breeds (Newfoundlands are a good example) can be relatively inactive when mature. Dogs with high activity levels may not be a good choice for someone whose mobility is limited. Smaller, active dogs (such as small poodles or terriers) may not be able to tolerate the rough play of young children.\nOne critically important consideration is whether the dog will be good with children or infants. Some breeds are generally better with children than others, but most dogs that are raised with children see them as just another family member. In these situations, the dog should be trained to respond properly to all members of the family. Adult dogs that are accustomed to a household without children may resent the attention given to a new child, resulting in behavioral problems such as aggression or soiling in the house. In any event, the early interactions when children are introduced into a household with dogs, and vice versa, should be closely monitored. Children or infants should never be left unsupervised with a dog."

Puppies raised with your family usually integrate well into your environment, and a strong bond usually forms naturally. However, the adult size and activity level of a mixed-breed puppy can be difficult to predict. All puppies have a lot of energy and require a great deal of attention and supervision, especially during the early, housetraining period. Puppies also require a greater initial investment in veterinary care ( see Puppy Care). On the other hand, adult dogs may have some initial difficulty adapting to your family or lifestyle and many need additional time and attention to adjust to their new environment. If you are able to obtain a medical and behavioral history from the previous owner or a shelter, this can be invaluable in assessing whether a particular dog is right for you."

If you want a purebred dog, you should search for registered breeders in your area. Shelters are often a good source of mixed-breed puppies, and purebred dogs are also often available.

Is the facility clean and well organized? Do the dogs look happy, or scared and timid? Do the dogs look healthy, or thin and sickly? Is the temperature of the building comfortable, with fresh water available to all animals? Many problems can also be “sniffed out.” Foul odors or dank, humid air suggest a building that is dirty or poorly ventilated. A clean kennel should smell slightly of disinfectant, not strongly of urine or feces. The puppies themselves should not smell of urine or feces."

Name-brand dog foods are backed by scientific research and quality control to provide complete, balanced nutrition for your pet. Dry food is generally preferable to canned because it promotes healthy teeth and gums (while providing the same nutrition). Diets that are specifically formulated for the various stages of a dog’s life (including puppy, adult, and senior) are widely available in grocery stores, pet shops, and other outlets such as pet “superstores.” Specialty diets for specific problems (such as obesity, food allergy, or kidney disease) have also been developed; many of these diets are prescription diets that are available only through veterinarians.\nMost adult dogs are fed 1 to 2 times daily, although puppies require more frequent feeding see Diet. Large-breed dogs should be fed at least twice a day to prevent eating large amounts that can lead to bloat. Your veterinarian can help you estimate your dog’s daily caloric needs, which can then be provided in multiple feedings of equal size. Meals should be provided in a quiet corner, away from the hustle and bustle of family life. This fosters proper digestion and avoids gorging and possessive aggression.\nOne of the biggest problems in pets is overfeeding, which can lead to obesity, other serious diseases (such as heart disease and arthritis), and a shortened life span. Only the proper amounts of a quality dog food should be fed. Table food should not be fed or should be minimized; it should never exceed 10% of your dog’s daily caloric requirements. Your veterinarian can provide an estimate of the proper type and amount of food for your dog to maintain your dog’s ideal weight. As a general rule, a dog is at proper weight when the ribs and spinal vertebrae (backbones) can be felt, with only a small amount of underlying fat and other body tissues.\nFresh, clean water should always be available to your dog.

Several others (referred to as noncore) are important in certain regions and situations (for example, Bordetella, Lyme disease). Your veterinarian can advise which vaccines are necessary in your local area and circumstances.\nTraditionally, booster vaccinations have been given every year throughout the dog’s life to ensure ongoing protection. However, the need for yearly revaccination has been questioned in recent years. Some data indicate that after the first year of life, immunity lasts long enough so that booster vaccinations are needed only every few years. However, the debate is ongoing. Your veterinarian will be aware of the most recent findings and can advise you about the best vaccination program for your pet."

        "title": "Parasite Control",
        "content": "The primary intestinal parasites of dogs include roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms. These worms damage the digestive tract or interfere with absorption of essential nutrients, or both. Intestinal parasite infections are diagnosed by finding worm eggs (or sometimes actual worms or worm segments) in fecal samples. Fecal samples should be tested periodically (yearly or on the schedule recommended by your veterinarian) in all dogs and more frequently in puppies, which are especially prone to parasite infection. These worms usually do not cause intestinal infection in people; however, hookworm infections leading to abdominal pain and inflammation have developed in people with weakened immune systems. Roundworm larvae also have the potential to infect people. When infective roundworm eggs are ingested, they can develop into larvae in the intestine and potentially migrate into sensitive organs. This migration is much more likely to occur in children and people with weakened immune systems. Sanitation is key to prevention because roundworm eggs take about 30 days to become infective; thus, promptly cleaning up feces from your yard can essentially eliminate potential exposure.\nHeartworm is an especially serious parasite that is transmitted by mosquito bites. These worms live in the major blood vessels of the lung, causing inflammation of the blood vessels and potentially resulting in heart damage and early death. Because treatment of heartworm infection carries a number of serious health risks and is also potentially fatal, prevention is critical. The Companion Animal Parasite Council, an assembly of experts in veterinary medicine and parasitology, recommend year-round heartworm prevention for dogs, because it is impossible to accurately predict all times when mosquitoes will be present. Additionally, most heartworm preventives contain medications that also treat for intestinal parasites, which can be transmitted at all times of the year. Blood tests to check for heartworm disease should be done yearly.\nCommon external parasites include fleas, ticks, and mange mites. Monthly preventive treatments are available to control fleas and ticks, and are administered as body sprays or “spot-on” preparations that are placed on the skin between the shoulder blades. Mange mites can be detected by scraping the skin of infected areas for signs of mites or their eggs. Signs of mange include red, scaly areas or bald patches on the skin, or both."

Allowing a female to go through a heat or to have a litter is not necessary. In fact, the surgery is safest and the future medical benefits are greatest when it is done before the first heat, or estrus, has started. Males are usually neutered between 5 and 10 months of age, depending on breed and size."

Vaccinations cannot effectively stimulate the puppy’s immune system until this maternal immunity wears off. Because maternal immunity declines slowly over time, puppies should be vaccinated every 2 to 3 weeks until they are about 4 months old. This ensures that the puppy receives an effective dose of vaccine soon after maternal protection is gone. Restricting access to unvaccinated dogs until the full series of vaccinations has been given is important to avoid disease.\nIntestinal parasites are most common in puppies. Larvae are often passed through the placenta or mother’s milk. Worms are so common that new puppies are often treated with a broad-spectrum wormer as a routine preventive measure. Fecal examinations, with additional treatments as necessary, are usually done every 2 to 4 weeks, until 2 successive fecal examinations are negative."

The key is to take the puppy outdoors at the times that dogs naturally eliminate and to praise them enthusiastically when they do. Establishing a designated area that the puppy can associate with elimination can be helpful. If accidents happen, take your pet outside to the designated elimination area and praise it for eliminating (if it does so). Punishment, such as rubbing a dog’s nose in urine or feces, does no good and can even have a negative effect on training. Each accident indoors sets the process back a little, so the fewer accidents, the better.\nAll dogs should learn to pay attention and respond to everyone in the household. Teaching young dogs basic obedience commands, including sit, stay, down, come, and heel, increases the control that you have over your dog, which can prevent potentially dangerous situations (such as running away or running into the street). Dogs have an early socialization period, lasting from roughly 2 to 4 months of age. During this time, they more easily learn to accept new people, places, animals, and other experiences. Giving your puppy positive experience with new events during this period can help reduce the chances of fearful behavior and other problems later in life.\nMany good books are available on raising and training puppies. In addition, many local trainers, kennels, and community services offer socialization and obedience classes. Socialization classes can begin as early as 8 weeks of age, with obedience classes generally starting at 4 to 6 months of age. In general, obedience training is an activity that you and your dog learn together. The trainer teaches you, and you teach your dog. It takes only a few hours per week, is generally fun for both you and your pet, and can establish good behavior and a strong family bond for the life of your dog."

      "title": "Introduction to Behavior of Dogs",
      "content": "Behavioral medicine is the scientific study of everything animals do, whether the animals are insects, birds, mammals, fish, or people. The field of animal behavior is concerned with understanding the causes, functions, development, and evolution of behavior. Behavior refers to the actions or reactions of an organism. Behavior is usually in relation to the environment, and is controlled by the endocrine and nervous systems. The complexity of animal behavior is related to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, animals with complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to learn new responses and thus adjust their behavior.\nAn animal’s behavior is influenced by many factors. Some of these factors include genetic predisposition, experience and learning, environment, and physiology. Several dog studies have shown that behavior can be inherited to some degree. In addition, maternal influences can affect personality and temperament. If puppies are separated from a fearful mother, the puppies are less likely to be fearful than if they are left with their mother. The effect of other puppies in the litter, the amount and type of human handling, and exposure to new objects and experiences all influence a dog’s behavior. The brain and its associated neurotransmitters also play a fundamental role in temperament and behavior. Abnormal levels of various hormones play a role in certain forms of aggression and fear.\nUnderstanding the nature of behavior problems is essential to developing a rational basis for their treatment. While this chapter focuses primarily on the abnormal behavior of dogs, the extent to which a dog’s behavior is abnormal is defined by how much it deviates from “normal” or by the severity of the problem that this behavior poses to its owner."

      "title": "Diagnosing Behavior Problems in Dogs",
      "content": "Many “health” problems faced by pet dogs are associated with behavior problems or unmet expectations about the pet’s behavior. Your veterinarian will first need to rule out any possible health problems that could be causing your pet's behavior to change. For example, a medical condition could be causing your pet to urinate in the house. Your veterinarian will take a behavioral history before making any diagnosis. A behavioral history generally includes the following: 1) the sex, breed, and age of the dog; 2) the age at onset of the condition; 3) the duration of the condition; 4) a description of the actual behavior; 5) the frequency of the problem behavior (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly); 6) the duration of a typical episode (seconds, minutes, hours); 7) any change in pattern, frequency, intensity, and duration of episodes; 8) any corrective measures tried and the response; 9) any activities that stopped the behavior (for example, the dog falls asleep); 10) the 24-hour schedule of the dog and owner, as well as any day-to-day changes; 11) the dog’s family history (in other words, are there signs of similar problems in the dog’s parents or littermates?); 12) the dog's environment and housing; and 13) anything else the owner thinks is relevant.\nYou and your veterinarian should consider the \"ABCs\" of the behavior problem. What happens prior to the behavior (the Antecedent)? What is the Behavior? What happens immediately afterward (the Consequences)? Because behaviors can change as dogs learn and mature, your veterinarian will also consider how the problem initially started.\nModern veterinary care includes routine screening questions about specific behavior complaints—such as inappropriate or undesirable chewing, growling, or odd behavior—in addition to routine questions that alert your veterinarian to potential medical problems. This routine screening helps establish what is normal for your dog. If your veterinarian does not ask about behavior problems, be sure to mention them yourself. Unfortunately, many owners do not report behavior problems to their veterinarians, and these problems are a major reason pets are given away or put to sleep.\nBecause behavioral diagnoses cannot be made on the basis of a one-time event, pet owners can complete a questionnaire at each visit to mark the patterns of the dog’s behavior. Your veterinarian can then identify whether the signs (barking, growling, lunging) create a pattern that meets specific diagnostic criteria such as fear aggression or protective aggression ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Both you and your veterinarian must use the same definitions for the same nonspecific signs. You both must also accurately recognize and describe behaviors that are of concern.\nVideo of your dog’s behavior can help ensure that your veterinarian makes an accurate diagnosis. The questionnaire relies on your description and, because of this, is more subjective. However, when combined with video, your veterinarian can use questionnaires to diagnose behavior problems. When you recognize the behaviors leading to or associated with the problematic ones, you can avoid or prevent the situation that leads up to the problem. By viewing the problematic behavior on video, your veterinarian can work with you to help treat the condition.",
      "Defining the Problem": {
        "title": "Defining the Problem",
        "content": "The following is a brief glossary of terms commonly used when discussing behavior.\nAn abnormal behavior is one that is dysfunctional and unusual. This is different from a behavioral complaint, which can be a normal but undesirable action (such as jumping up, getting into the garbage, or herding).\nAbnormal repetitive behaviors occur when dogs do not adjust to a situation in an appropriate way, often responding with repetitive or fixed movements or actions. Abnormal repetitive behaviors include both compulsive/impulsive and stereotypic behaviors (see below). Examples include signs pertaining to the mouth (eating non-food objects, licking, gulping, and excessive eating), brain (repeated jaw snapping, light chasing), movement (spinning, pouncing), or self-directed injuries (hair plucking, excessive skin licking).\nAggression in animals is everything related to a threat or attack. There are various kinds of aggressive behavior in animals, such as territorial defense, predatory aggression, and inter-male aggression ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Examples of aggressive acts include biting, growling, and scratching.\nAnxiety is the anticipation of danger accompanied by signs of tension (vigilance, increased movement, and tense muscles). The focus of anxiety can be internal or external.\nCompulsive or obsessive-compulsive disorders are abnormal and repetitive behaviors typically done in an attempt to achieve a goal. These intense behaviors may be difficult to interrupt or be uncontrollable. They can start from normal behaviors (such as grooming or eating) and normal situations (frustration or conflict) but then progress to inappropriate situations and intensities. Some compulsive behaviors appear to be genetic, such as tail chasing in German Shepherds or flank skin sucking in Doberman Pinschers.\nA dog in conflict has tendencies to perform more than one type of activity at once. For example, a dog may want to approach a person to get a treat, but may also be afraid of the person and unwilling to come too close. The motivation for the conflict, except for extreme instances associated with survival functions (for example, eating), is very hard to identify in animals. Conflict might result in aggression or displacement behaviors (see below).\nDisplacement activity is the resolution of a conflict by performing a seemingly unrelated activity. Because the animal is physically or behaviorally unable to act appropriately, it will often perform an apparently irrelevant activity. Examples of these irrelevant activities are grooming, feeding, scratching, and sleeping. It is less specific than redirected behavior, which is directed toward another target.\nDominance refers to competition over a limited resource (for example, a treat, a favorite toy, or a comfortable resting place). A higher-ranking animal can displace a lower-ranking one from the resource. Rank or hierarchy is usually defined by an ability to control the resource. A dominant animal is not the one engaged in the most fighting. Most high-ranking animals can be identified by the submissive behavior exhibited toward them by others in their group. Dominance terminology applies to communication between members of a single species (dog-to-dog) but does not apply to communication between species (human-to-dog).\nFear is a feeling of apprehension associated with the presence of an object, individual, or social situation and is part of normal behavior. Deciding whether a fear is abnormal depends on the context. For example, fire is a useful tool, and fear of being burned by it is normal. However, if the house were not on fire, such a fear would be irrational. If this fear was constant or recurrent, it would probably be considered an abnormal behavior. Normal and abnormal fears usually vary in intensity. The intensity increases as the real or imagined nearness of the object that causes the fear increases.\nFrustration arises when a dog is unable to complete a behavior due to physical or psychological obstacles. When pets are frustrated, they can respond with redirected behavior, a displacement activity, or anxiety. For example, a dog that is frustrated by being unable to get to a cat on the other side of a fence can respond by attacking another household pet. This term, like dominance, is overused and usually undefined, which means it often is not very helpful when diagnosing a behavior problem.\nMost fearful reactions are learned and can be unlearned with gradual exposure. Phobias, though, are profound, fearful reactions that do not diminish either with gradual exposure to the object or without exposure over time. A phobia involves sudden, all-or-nothing, profound, abnormal reactions resulting in panic. Phobias may develop quickly or over time, but once established they are characterized by immediate and intense anxiety. Fear may develop more gradually and, within an episode of fearful behavior, there may be more variation in intensity than would be seen in a phobic reaction. Once a phobic event has been experienced, any event associated with it or the memory of it is enough to generate the reaction. Even without re-exposure, such as the use of a shock collar on a dog, phobias can remain at or exceed their former high level for years. Phobic situations are either avoided at all costs or, if unavoidable, are endured with intense anxiety or distress. There also appears to be a genetic or hereditary basis for these responses in some canine breeds.\nRedirected behavior is directed away from the inciting target and toward another, less appropriate target.\nStereotypic behaviors are repetitious, relatively unvaried actions that have no obvious purpose or function. They are usually derived from normal behavior, such as grooming, eating, or walking. These behaviors are abnormal because they interfere with the normal functioning of the animal.\nVacuum activity can occur when an animal cannot perform a highly desired instinctive behavior. Examples include flank sucking and excessive licking. Vacuum activities have no useful purpose."

Early on, owners will usually need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian. Treatment for abnormal behaviors takes time and commitment from pet owners. Quick fixes or \"magic pills\" do not exist for behavior problems. In addition, the safety of household members, other pets, and the pet itself must be considered, especially in the cases of aggression. Modifying a pet's behavior involves behavior modification techniques to promote and reward desirable behaviors; the use of products that improve safety, reduce anxiety, or quicken improvements (for example, muzzles or no-pull head halters); and, possibly, drugs and supplements."

A behavior modification technique called flooding, described below, is not used very often because it is more likely to make animals worse. While it is claimed that punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people use punishment correctly. For punishment (such as screaming at the dog) to be successful, it must occur at the beginning of the behavior, be consistently delivered, and be strong enough to stop the unwanted behavior. Most punishments are not given at the right time or are not the appropriate type for the situation. \"Dominance\" training techniques that encourage owners to assert leadership through physical confrontations are also not recommended. Multiple studies have shown that training based on punishments or confrontations are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression. Dogs trained with rewards have fewer behavioral problems and are less fearful.",
      "Behavior Modification Techniques": {
        "title": "Behavior Modification Techniques",
        "content": "Most of the techniques involved in behavior modification are not hard to learn and can be successfully used as preventive techniques. They do require a regular investment of time and effort, however. The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in these techniques.\nHabituation is a simple form of learning that involves no rewards. It is merely the ending of or decrease in a response to a situation that results from repeated or prolonged exposure to that situation. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road may at first run away when traffic passes, but eventually learn to ignore it. A dog that habituates to one type of sound does not, as a consequence of this habituation, automatically become habituated to other sounds. Habituation is not the same as failing to respond to stimulation as a result of fatigue, sensory adaptation, or injury. The effects of habituation are generally long lasting. However, if an animal is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful stimulus (such as a predator) without being harmed, habituation does not generally occur. Because of this, scientists believe that responses to dangerous stimuli may have an inherited resistance to habituation. If the fearful response is too intense, the dog may become more fearful instead of adjusting to the stimulus.\nSpontaneous recovery is associated with habituation. If there is a long period of time between when a dog has experienced an event to which it had habituated and re-exposure to the same event, the dog may again react. For example, a puppy barks to get a reaction. The more the owner attempts to quiet it, the more the puppy barks. It will continue this pattern because it is getting the attention it wanted. Even if the attention is “negative,” some puppies will find it rewarding. The best method to discourage the behavior is to ignore it. Eventually the puppy stops barking if the owner consistently ignores it. However, the bad behavior comes back every now and then. This is called spontaneous recovery.\nConditioning refers to associations between stimuli and behavior. For example, a hungry dog drools (the behavior) when it sees food (the stimulus). After this, every time that the hungry dog sees the food a bell is rung (a second stimulus). Once the food and bell have been paired several times, the dog will drool even if it just hears the bell. This is called conditioning. The bell generates the same response as the sight of food. After several times, the dog has learned to associate the bell with the food. Conditioning can be positive or negative. For example, the sound of a doorbell can cause fear or excitement in a dog, depending on whether the dog likes or dislikes visitors.\nReinforcement is any event that increases the chances that a certain behavior will be repeated. Reinforcements can be positive or negative. When positive reinforcement (a reward) is used in training, there is a positive relationship between the behavior and its consequences. The more the pet does a behavior, the more it gets positive reinforcement. This makes that behavior increase. A negative reinforcement (which is mistakenly thought of as punishment by many people) is something unpleasant that increases a behavior when it is removed. For example, being held tightly may be unpleasant to a squirming puppy. But the hold is released only when the puppy calms down. After several times, the release from restraint will increase the chance that the puppy will relax faster.\nSecond-order reinforcers are signals that can be used at a distance to let the dog know that a reward is coming. Commonly used second-order reinforcers are words, such as “good girl,” hand signals, and clickers. By carefully pairing these with a primary reward (such as food or petting), second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would. For example, a clicker can be associated with patting on the head as a reward for sitting and staying. By associating the clicker with a reward, you can train the dog to sit and stay from farther away and still reward the behavior by using the clicker. Positive training and clicker training have become very popular. However, it is possible to do an excellent job at positive training without using any second-order reinforcers. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing. In some situations involving problem behaviors, the incorrect use of a clicker may hinder, rather than help, a behavior modification program.\nExtinction is a response that stops when a reward is removed. A classic example of extinction involves a dog that jumps up on people for attention. If people pet the dog, the behavior continues. If they stop petting the dog, the dog will eventually stop jumping up because the reward is no longer there. However, even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping will reinforce the pattern. The more valuable the original reward, the longer it has been present, and the more uncertainty there is about whether the reward has been truly removed, the greater the resistance to extinction. Resistance to extinction can also occur even without reinforcement if the reward was good enough and was tightly linked to the behavior.\nBecause there is often an association between getting the reward and the intensity of the behavior, the intensity or frequency of the behavior you are trying to eliminate usually increases at the beginning of extinction. In other words, a behavior you are trying to extinguish may get worse before it gets better. It is critical that you do not give in. Giving in will only make extinction more difficult. The dog will learn that, although your threshold has increased, the dog can override it by working harder.\nOverlearning is the repeated performance of an already learned behavior. It is frequently used in training for specific events, and may also be useful for preventing fearful responses in dogs. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, it increases the resistance to extinction, and it increases the chance that the behavior will become an automatic or “knee-jerk” response in similar situations. This aspect can be extremely useful in teaching a dog to overcome a fear or anxiety.\nShaping is a learning technique that works well for dogs that do not know what response is desired by the trainer. Shaping works through gradual approximations and allows the dog to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For example, when teaching a puppy to sit, giving the puppy a food treat for squatting will increase the chance that squatting will be repeated. This squatting behavior is then rewarded only when it becomes more exaggerated, and finally, when it becomes a true sit.\nDesensitization is a way to gradually teach a dog to tolerate a situation by carefully exposing it to that situation in small steps. If a puppy gets overexcited at the sound of the doorbell, a tape recording of the doorbell could help stop the undesirable behavior. If the tape is played very softly at first and then only gradually increased in volume as long as the puppy remains calm, then the puppy may stop reacting to the doorbell.\nCounterconditioning is a method for reducing unwanted behavior by teaching the dog to replace it with another more favorable behavior. In the doorbell example above, the puppy will learn faster if it is first taught to sit, stay, and then relax in exchange for a treat. The puppy must be absolutely quiet and calm, and convey by its eyes, body posture, and facial expressions that it would do anything for its owner. Once this behavior is learned, the desensitization is added by playing the tape recording at a gradually increasing volume. If at any time the puppy starts to get too excited, the tape recording should be lowered in volume until the puppy relaxes. Relaxing is the key and is the first step to changing the behavior. Counterconditioning and desensitization can take a lot of time and effort. The exercises must be frequently repeated so that the unwanted behavior decreases until it is no longer a problem.\nFlooding is prolonged exposure to a stimulus until the dog eventually stops reacting. This is the opposite of the approach taken in desensitization. It is far more stressful than any of the other treatment strategies and if not used correctly will make things worse. The most common problem is increased fear. This technique should be used only by a professional and only as a last resort.\nPunishment is also known as aversive conditioning. It is any unpleasant event that lowers the chance that a behavior will be repeated. Punishment can be positive or negative. Positive punishment refers to applying something unpleasant to decrease a behavior, whereas negative punishment refers to removing something positive to decrease a behavior. Punishment is not the same as negative reinforcement ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). To be most successful, punishment must occur as early as possible (within a few seconds of the start of the behavior), and it must be consistent and appropriate. Critical factors in punishment include timing, consistency, appropriate intensity, and the presence of a reward after the undesirable behavior ends. This is the most frequently ignored part of treatment for people whose pets have behavior problems. Owners often resort to physical punishment as the first choice, but punishment does not need to be physical. Furthermore, punishment is just as hard to use correctly as counterconditioning and desensitization. Punishment is never an “easy out” and has a high chance of failure. It can also lead to other negative consequences, such as increasing the chance of fear or aggression.\nThe Premack Principle states that more likely behaviors will reinforce less likely behaviors. When misbehaving increases the likelihood that a dog achieves a goal, the more likely the dog is to misbehave. To prevent the misbehavior, the owner can teach the dog an alternative, positive behavior; for example, teaching a dog to sit and stay before allowing it outside may deter bolting.\nResponse substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desired one. An example is teaching a dog to lay down instead of jumping up. Owners should begin in a calm environment where success is likely, then progress to places with more distractions as the behavior is learned. Dogs may first need to be desensitized to the stimuli for response substitution to be successful."

The limitations of medication use include the potential for adverse effects, cost, the need to treat for a considerable length of time before the medication takes effect, limited information on what medication is most effective, and the potential that the problem will reappear once the medication is withdrawn.\nAll medications have the potential to cause side effects. Fortunately, most of the modern antianxiety and antidepressant medications used in pets are well tolerated. Gastrointestinal upsets (leading to reduced appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea) are the most common side effects seen. In some pets, decreased activity or lethargy may occur in the first week or so of treatment as the animal adjusts to the medication. (This reaction typically disappears on its own.) More serious side effects, including potentially fatal inflammation of the liver, seizures, or other signs of toxicity have been reported in rare cases. Most of the medications used for behavior problems in pets were designed for use in people. Few have been directly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in animals, although such use is not prohibited. This means that there may be limited information available on safety, toxicity, and effectiveness in dogs or other animals.\nBecause this is a relatively new area of veterinary medicine, demonstration of effectiveness through research has not been done in many cases. Veterinarians often must rely on case reports, their own clinical experience, and presentations at meetings to learn which medications and what dosage to recommend. Individual pets vary in their response to medication, just as people do. As a result, there will always be some element of trial and error in determining whether a particular medication will help solve a behavior problem.\nIf medication is used without behavior modification or environmental changes (and even when it is used with these techniques in some cases), the unwanted behavior may return once the medication is discontinued. Some problems may require treatment for a year or longer. In most cases medication is used for a period of several months.\nDespite these limitations, medication has the potential to be very helpful in a wide range of pet behavior problems, including fear-related problems like separation anxiety and thunderstorm phobias, compulsive behaviors like lick granulomas, and some types of aggression. Drugs and some supplements can help normalize your dog's emotions and improve your ability to train anxious, overreactive, or fearful dogs. They can also improve a pet's welfare. Your veterinarian can discuss whether medication might be appropriate for your dog."

      "title": "Normal Social Behavior in Dogs",
      "content": "Dogs are highly social animals and are well adapted to living in groups. Studies have also shown that they are very good at interpreting human gestures and behavior. Dogs interact with each other and people through body postures, facial expressions, tail and ear positions, raising of hair or \"hackles,\" vocalizations, and scents. Although dogs evolved from the grey wolf 12,000-14,000 years ago, domestication and breeding practices have created variations in appearance, temperament, and social signaling. These variations can make it difficult for dogs and people to communicate with different breeds. Early and frequent socialization with many different dogs can help improve a dog's ability to interact with other dogs and people.\nBetween 3 to 8 weeks of age, dogs tend to focus on other dogs (if available) for social interaction, and between 5 to 12 weeks of age they shift their focus to people. Dogs are most receptive to learning how to deal with new situations until about 16 to 20 weeks of age. After this age, dogs do not stop learning from exposure; they just do so at a much slower rate and perhaps in a different way. It is not critical to change the focus of exposure at one specific period, because given adequate opportunities, puppies will learn about the social and physical environments when they are ready. Dogs that are kept exclusively kenneled or not exposed to people by 14 weeks of age may have severely undeveloped social skills. The best age to adopt a puppy is at about 8 weeks of age. Unless there is no other choice, puppies should not be adopted until at least 7½ weeks of age.\nSexual maturity in domestic dogs occurs between 6 to 9 months of age (later for giant breeds), while social maturity develops at 12 to 36 months of age. In free-ranging groups, dogs that challenge the established social hierarchy may leave and form their own groups if they do not succeed in gaining a high rank. This situation may be similar to one form of inter-dog aggression that occurs in multiple-dog households ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Social maturity is also the time when problems with aggression and anxiety develop. Roaming, mounting, urine marking, and fighting are stimulated by sex hormones, particularly testosterone. These problems are often greatly reduced in males by neutering.\nMost domestic dogs, except for Basenjis, have 2 heat (estrous) cycles per year. All members of the group may assist in puppy care. In multiple-dog groups, the highest-ranking dogs may be the only ones to breed.\nAlthough the dog's social structure has been referred to as \"pack hierarchy,\" it is not an accurate description of dogs' relationship with each other or with people. Hierarchy in dogs is not set in a straight line. Instead, it flows based on what resource the animals desire. It is maintained primarily by lower-ranking dogs giving way to higher-ranking ones and not, as commonly believed, by fighting. In addition, it only applies to a dog's relationship to other dogs, not to its interaction with people.",

        "title": "Counseling to Prevent Undesirable Behavior",
        "content": "Your veterinarian and their staff can work with breeders, trainers, pet stores, and shelters to ensure that newly adopted dogs get off to the right start. For puppies, this includes advice on socialization, normal dog behavior (eg, jumping up, play biting, elimination) and how it can be managed, a household environment that provides appealing but safe outlets for all of the dog’s behavioral needs (eg, chewing, social play, object play, rest), advice on dog communication, and learning principles of reward-based training. The goal should be to reinforce desirable behaviors and to ignore or prevent unwanted behaviors. Clicker training can be particularly useful to immediately mark and reward desirable behavior and gradually teach behaviors that more closely approximate the final desired outcome (for example, relaxation). Chewing and biting are common problems, because puppies need to explore and play and use their mouths to explore their world. Therefore, providing constructive social activities that do not include mouthing or biting people, such as tug games, retrieving, walking and running, chasing, hide and seek, playing with other dogs, and training for rewards, gives the puppy something positive on which to focus. A head halter is also an option for better control of the head and muzzle. Another way to manage chewing and biting is to provide chew toys, food-stuffed toys, and food-dispensing toys. When the puppy cannot be effectively supervised, the household should be set up to ensure success (and avoid failure). Preventing undesirable behaviors while providing the dog with options acceptable to the owners and the dog gives the dog control to make choices, reduces uncertainty and anxiety, and prevents undesirable behaviors. Of particular value to establish a safe haven is a crate, exercise pen, or room to provide security and safety for the dog when it cannot be supervised or wants to be alone. A daily routine can be established that provides stability and predictability for the dog, beginning with meeting the dog's social and physical needs, followed by sessions of inattention during which the dog is given the opportunity to nap and rest or to engage in exploratory play with its food and chew toys. By confining the dog to a crate, pen, or room during these “inattention” times, the dog learns to spend time on its own; this also may prevent damage to property, housesoiling, and even separation anxiety. Undesirable behavior might alternatively be prevented through environmental management (eg, child gate, shutting doors, tie downs, deterrent devices). Neutering males may also help to prevent testosterone-influenced behaviors such as urine marking, mounting, and roaming."

      "Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression": {
        "title": "Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression",
        "content": "The most common behavior problems in dogs are those associated with aggression. Most cases involve a dog's attempt to distance itself from the situation. There are many types of aggressive behaviors with different motivations, but fear, anxiety, uncertainty (conflict), inheritance (genetics), and previous learning are usually involved. Because of the risk of injury and the risk of worsening aggression, it is important to seek help from a veterinarian as soon as any signs of aggression occur. Early on, owners typically need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian.\nFear aggression occurs in situations that make a dog afraid. Fear causes most types of aggression. Fearful dogs may try to avoid the triggering threat but can become aggressive when they cannot escape (for example, when they are leashed, cornered, or being held), when they are motivated to stay (for example, proximity to a family member, property, or food), or learn that acting aggressively can remove the threat. Animals that learn that aggression \"works\" to eliminate threats may act aggressively even when they are not threatened. Poor socialization, temperament (inherited from parents), previous punishment, and learning can also lead to fear aggression.\nFood-related aggression is shown around pet food, bones, rawhides, biscuits, or human food in dogs that are not starved or abused.\nIdiopathic aggression has no known cause. It is unpredictable and unprovoked. This type of aggression is extremely rare.\nImpulse control aggression, also called irritable or conflict aggression, is a threat or attack shown by dogs toward people under any circumstance that involves correction of the dog’s behavior by its owner. Diagnosis of this problem is difficult and cannot be based on a single event. Aggression toward family members is often mistakenly called dominance aggression. However, aggression toward family members is most commonly due to fear, possessive aggression, redirected behavior, or conflict (ie, the dog desires two opposite activities at once). Situations that often provoke aggression from the dog include physical restraint and control of food, toys, or resting places.\nInter-dog aggression is aggression that is directed at other dogs. The target can be another dog in the household or dogs that are encountered away from the home.\nMaternal aggression is excessive aggression by a mother dog toward people, other dogs, or her puppies. A small amount of aggression may be normal, especially around the time of weaning. High levels of aggression may harm the puppies. The aggression should resolve after the puppies stop nursing. The behavior can also occur in females with \"false pregnancies\" and should resolve after hormone levels return to normal. This abnormal behavior may be inherited.\nPain aggression is a defensive reaction that occurs when a dog is in pain. It may happen when a dog anticipates being moved or touched. Organ dysfunction (kidney or liver), neurologic diseases, and hormonal disorders (of the adrenal, sex, or thyroid glands) can also lead to aggression. This is why veterinarians rule out medical causes of aggression.\nPlay aggression occurs along with play behaviors, such as play bows, chases, and charges. In contrast to previously held beliefs, energetic play by humans with dogs (for example, tug-of-war) does not necessarily produce play aggression.\nPossessive aggression is constantly directed toward another individual that approaches or attempts to obtain a nonfood object or toy that the dog possesses.\nPredatory aggression is behavior associated with predation (for example, stalking, hunting, and catching small animals). It is usually a quiet, sudden attack, and involves a fierce bite and shake of the prey animal.\nProtective aggression is an attempt by a dog to guard its owner from an approach by another person, in the absence of a real threat from the other person. The aggression intensifies as the other person gets closer.\nRedirected aggression occurs when a dog is prevented from reaching its intended target. The attack is then directed at another dog or person. The aggression is not accidental and the dog will actively pursue the second dog or person, particularly if they are directly associated with the interruption of the dog’s attack on its first target.\nTerritorial aggression is the protection of a place, such as a yard or a car, from the approach of another dog or person. It includes actions like chasing, growling, barking, or biting. The territorial dog reacts regardless of whether or not the individual approaching acts in any sort of threatening manner.\nOther types of aggression can also occur in dogs. In rare cases, aggression can result from infection, toxicity, or side effects from a medication.",

          "content": "Treatment of aggression in dogs is typically complex and should ideally be designed by a specialist. Avoidance of situations that provoke aggression is always a good idea and can help reduce the risk of bites. Almost without exception, physical punishment, including the use of prong collars and electric shock collars can make an already aggressive dog worse. These techniques are not recommended, especially in the absence of professional supervision."

        "title": "Behavior Problems Associated with Elimination",
        "content": "Excitement urination is the release of a small amount of urine that occurs when a dog is active and excited, but not afraid.\nIncomplete housetraining is consistent elimination in undesirable locations that is not associated with a lack of access or an illness. At 8 to 9 weeks of age dogs start to develop a habit of eliminating in certain places, so early attention to housetraining is important.\nMarking behavior is urination or defecation that is used to send a social signal. For example, male dogs often lift a leg to urinate small amounts on fences, trees, or other objects. This can be an attempt to claim the area as their territory or just a way of letting other dogs know they’ve been there recently. Some dogs will mark when they visit new households, usually to \"cover up\" the odors of other animals. Usually, dogs will partially or fully lift their legs when they mark. It is most common in unneutered males, but females (both spayed and unneutered) and neutered dogs can also mark.\nSubmissive urination occurs in an otherwise housetrained dog only when the dog is showing postures associated with submission (for example, head lowered, ears back). The dog does not show any signs of fear or aggression.",
        "Treatment": {
          "title": "Treatment",
          "content": "There are two main aspects of housetraining: 1) encouraging a preference for a specific surface (for example, dirt or grass) or location, and 2) encouraging inhibition of urination or defecation until the appropriate location is accessible. The first age at which a dog is able to voluntarily inhibit elimination is at 8½ weeks of age. Appropriate housetraining for dogs involves exposure to the preferred surface for elimination starting at that age, absence of physical punishment, emphasis on positive reinforcement, frequent trips to the desired area, continuous supervision to avoid indoor accidents, quickly and completely cleaning up any accidents, and startling the dog to interrupt it only when the dog is caught in the act of eliminating in an inappropriate place. Punishment is not helpful and may be counterproductive. Dogs with submissive urination should never be startled. These are already anxious, uncertain dogs, and any punishment will worsen the behavior.\nTaking dogs outside 15 to 30 minutes after eating and immediately after play, awakening, or if they slow down, can help speed housetraining. Housetraining an older dog is more a matter of fine-tuning the dog’s behavior and encouraging it to select a more appropriate surface or location. The presence of an older dog may help when housetraining a puppy, because the puppy can follow the lead of the older dog. Prevention is important and owners should know that puppies obtained from pet stores are usually much more difficult to housetrain than those obtained from other sources. Puppies in a pet store are generally not taken out of their cages often and do not have to inhibit elimination. They also may have learned to play with or eat feces.\nDogs with medical conditions can urinate and defecate inappropriately. A veterinarian can rule out any underlying medical conditions."

      "Other Canine Behavior Problems": {
        "title": "Other Canine Behavior Problems",
        "content": "Some common behavior problems of dogs are identified below. Many can be treated with behavior modification programs that focus on desensitization and counterconditioning ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). This is very important in the early treatment of fears, phobias, and anxieties. Your veterinarian might also prescribe medication to help your pet.\nAbnormal ingestive behavior is eating unusual amounts or types of food or nonfood items. This includes pica (eating nonfood items), eating feces (coprophagia), drinking too much water, scavenging (seeking out food in the garbage or off countertops), anorexia (eating too little), overeating, and gorging (eating too fast). These behaviors can be a component of abnormal behaviors (such as compulsive disorders) or due to normal investigative and exploratory behaviors.\nAttention-seeking behavior occurs when the dog acts in a way that gets the attention of people who are doing something not directly involving the dog. An example of this would be a puppy that barks to get attention when it is not being actively played with. The owner then reacts to the dog’s bark by giving it attention; both positive (playing with the dog) and negative (yelling at the dog) attention from the owner reinforces this behavior. This may be an undesirable behavior, but it is common and it is certainly a behavior that people unconsciously reinforce in their pets.\nSenility, which is also called cognitive dysfunction, is similar in some ways to Alzheimer’s disease in people. Signs include a decrease in social interaction, loss of housetraining, disorientation (getting lost in familiar surroundings), and changes in sleep patterns. Physical and mental stimulation can slow down the signs of senility. Medication and a special diet are also available for treatment. These can delay the progression of signs, but will not reverse them.\nCompulsive disorders are repetitive behaviors that occur out of their normal circumstances, or much more often or for much longer periods than is normal (for example, incessant licking). The dog spends so much time doing the compulsive behavior that it does not have time for normal activities. Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors that have no obvious purpose or function.\nFalse pregnancy is a condition during which a dog acts as though it is pregnant, but is not. The dog may make a nest and may gather small objects that it protects as if they were puppies.\nDestructive behaviors include chewing, stealing, getting into the trash, and digging. They are normal exploratory behaviors seen in unsupervised dogs that aren't busy doing desirable activities. Exercise, reward-based training, and social enrichment can help when owners are home. When unsupervised, dogs should be confined away from areas they can destroy and given appropriate toys or chews.\nFear is a normal response to a real or perceived threat. Anxiety is a response to fear or apprehension when an animal anticipates a threat. Fear and anxiety have signs that overlap. Some nonspecific signs, such as avoidance, shaking, and trembling, can be characteristic of both fear and anxiety. Phobia is an exaggerated fear response that is sudden and profound and results in panic.\nHyperactivity is an extremely high level of activity that does not respond to correction, redirection, or restraint. True hyperactivity is rare in dogs and is different from overactivity. Overactive dogs are highly energetic and active, but are able to calm down and respond to human control.\nNeophobia(fear of new things) is active avoidance, escape, or anxiety directed at unfamiliar objects and situations.\nNoise phobia consists of a sudden and profound response to noise that leads to intense anxiety, panic, or attempts to escape confinement. The most common form is fear of thunderstorms, although fear of fireworks or other loud noises is also common.\nSeparation anxiety is a syndrome in which a dog panics when it is left alone. It causes intense anxiety and may lead the dog to bark, pace, or eliminate inside the house. Dogs that are confined commonly destroy kennels, walls, or doors in an attempt to reunite with their owners. Signs are often most severe within the first 15 to 30 minutes of the dog being left alone."

      "title": "Introduction to Blood Disorders of Dogs",
      "content": "Blood cells form and develop mostly in the bone marrow, that is, the tissue located in the cavities of bones. Blood performs a variety of important functions as it circulates throughout the body. It delivers oxygen and vital nutrients (such as vitamins, minerals, fats, and sugars) to the tissues. It carries carbon dioxide to the lungs to be exhaled and waste products to the kidneys and liver to be eliminated from the body. It transports hormones, which are chemical messengers, to various parts of the body, allowing those parts to communicate with each other. Blood also includes cells that fight infection and control bleeding.\nThere are 3 cellular elements of blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Basically, red blood cells supply the body with oxygen, white blood cells protect against infection, and platelets start the formation of blood clots.\nBlood disorders are quite diverse. They can occur as normal responses to abnormal situations; for example, a significant increase in the number of white blood cells in response to an infection or disease. They may also occur as primary abnormalities of the blood; for example, a deficiency of all cellular elements of the blood due to bone marrow failure. Furthermore, abnormalities may be quantitative (too many or too few cells) or qualitative (abnormalities in the way cells function). It is helpful to understand what the names of some blood disorders mean, as they often provide a description of the disorder itself ( see Table: Suffixes Used in Names of Blood Disorders).\nJust as there are various blood types in humans, there are multiple blood types in dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. A few blood banks for animals have been established. Like human blood banks, they depend on donated blood and can provide type-matched blood for use in emergencies or surgeries.",

      "title": "Red Blood Cells of Dogs",
      "content": "The main function of red blood cells (also called erythrocytes) is to carry oxygen to the tissues, where it is required for cellular metabolism. Oxygen molecules attach themselves to carrier molecules, called hemoglobin, which are the iron-containing proteins in red blood cells that give the cells their red color. Oxygen is carried from the lungs and delivered to all body tissues by the hemoglobin within red blood cells. Oxygen is used by cells to produce energy that the body needs. Carbon dioxide is left behind as a waste product during this process. The red blood cells then carry that carbon dioxide away from the tissues and back to the lungs, where it is exhaled. When the number of red blood cells is too low, this is called anemia. Having too few red blood cells means the blood carries less oxygen, resulting in fatigue and weakness. When the number of red blood cells is too high, which is called polycythemia, blood can become too thick, impairing the ability of the heart to deliver oxygen throughout the body. An animal’s metabolism is geared to protect both the red blood cells and the hemoglobin from damage. Interference with the formation or release of hemoglobin, the production or survival of red blood cells, or their metabolism causes disease.\nThe total number of red cells, and thus the oxygen-carrying capacity, remains constant over time in healthy animals. Mature red blood cells have a limited life span; their production and destruction must be carefully balanced, or disease develops.\nProduction of red blood cells begins with stem cells in the bone marrow and ends with the release of mature red blood cells into the body’s circulation. Within the bone marrow, all blood cells begin from a single cell type called a stem cell. The stem cell divides to form immature forms of red blood cells, white blood cells, or a platelet-producing cell. Those immature cells then divide again, mature even more, and ultimately become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets.\nThe rate of blood cell production is determined by the body’s needs. Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, stimulates development of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Erythropoietin increases if the body lacks oxygen (a condition called hypoxia). In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ that determines how much oxygen the body’s tissues are receiving and the major site of erythropoietin production; so chronic kidney failure leads to anemia. Erythropoietin plays a major role in determining whether to increase the number of stem cells entering red blood cell production, to shorten maturation time of the red blood cells, or to cause early release of red blood cells. Other factors that affect red blood cell production are the supply of nutrients (such as iron and vitamins) and cell-cell interactions between compounds that aid in their production. Some disorders are the direct result of abnormal red blood cell metabolism. For example, an inherited enzyme deficiency reduces the life span of red blood cells and causes a condition known as hemolytic anemia.\nIt is important to remember that a decrease in the total number of red blood cells in the body (anemia) is a sign of disease, not a specific diagnosis. Anemia may be caused by blood loss, destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis), or decreased production. In severe blood loss anemia, red blood cells are lost, but death usually results from the loss of total blood volume, rather than from the lack of oxygen caused by loss of red blood cells. Hemolysis may be caused by toxins, infections, abnormalities present at birth, drugs, or antibodies that attack the red blood cells. In dogs the most common cause of serious hemolysis is an antibody directed against that dog’s own red blood cells (immune-mediated hemolytic anemia).\nFactors that may prevent red blood cell production include bone marrow failure or malignancy, loss of erythropoietin secondary to kidney failure, certain drugs or toxins, longterm debilitating diseases, or antibodies targeted at developing red blood cells. The outlook and treatment depend on the underlying cause of the anemia.",

      "Phagocytes": {
        "title": "Phagocytes",
        "content": "Phagocytes (from the Greek word meaning “to eat”) are cells in the bloodstream and tissues that surround and consume foreign particles, cell waste material, and bacteria. Their main function is to defend against invading microorganisms by engulfing and destroying them. There are 2 types of phagocytes: granulocytes and mononuclear phagocytes.\nGranulocytes protect against bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Some types of granulocytes are involved in allergic reactions. Neutrophils are the most numerous of the white blood cells and are the first line of defense against bacterial invasion. Eosinophils and basophils are involved both in protection against some parasites and in the response to allergy. Mononuclear phagocytes have a single nucleus. They travel from the blood to tissues where they become large cells called macrophages that consume foreign particles and cell debris.\nAs with red blood cells, the production and number of phagocytes are tightly regulated by chemical messengers of the blood, including interleukins (chemicals found in white blood cells that stimulate them to fight infection). Unlike the red blood cells, which remain circulating in the blood, the phagocytes use the blood’s circulatory system as a pathway to the tissues. Because of this, the number of phagocytes in the blood can provide an indication of circumstances in the tissues and the function of the bone marrow. For example, the number of neutrophils increases when inflammation is present anywhere in the body. An abnormal response, such as a low number of circulating white blood cells due to marrow failure, infections, drugs, or toxins, can lower resistance to bacterial infections. Finally, those elements that produce phagocytes may become cancerous, resulting in a disease called myelogenous leukemia."

      "Lymphocytes": {
        "title": "Lymphocytes",
        "content": "Lymphocytes are white blood cells that recognize \"non-self\" antigens, such as infectious organisms, foreign tissue, and cancer cells. Lymphocyte production in mammals begins in the bone marrow. Lymphocytes then become T cells, B cells, or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes destined to protect cells from disease travel to the thymus (an organ located at the base of the neck) where they become T cells under the influence of hormones there. T cells are responsible for a variety of functions, especially fighting off viral infections and cancers. Most T cells remain in the circulation, but some are also present in the spleen and lymph nodes. The B cells are responsible for producing antibodies that coat invading organisms or foreign substances, marking them for elimination by the immune system. For example, bacteria coated with antibody are more easily recognized and removed by neutrophils or macrophages. Natural killer cells and some types of T cells (\"cytotoxic\" T cells) destroy foreign material, whereas antibodies and other T cells (\"helper\" T cells) stimulate other components of the immune system to do so. If lymphocytes are reduced or abnormal, the dog is immunodeficient and susceptible to a wide range of infections.\nAntibody molecules are called immunoglobulins. They fall into several classes, each of which has a different function. For example, one class (IgA) is commonly found in the lungs and intestines; another (IgM) is the first antibody produced in response to newly recognized foreign microorganisms; a third (IgG) is the main antibody in the bloodstream; and a fourth (IgE) is involved in allergic reactions.\nLymphocytes usually act appropriately to rid the body of foreign “invaders” that cause disease. However, sometimes lymphocytes do not react appropriately. One inappropriate response occurs when antibodies are produced against the body’s own cells, such as red blood cells. Another inappropriate response of the immune system is allergy. When antibody-primed cells are exposed to an allergen, the allergic reaction may be mild (hives) or life-threatening (anaphylaxis).\nAn increase in the number of lymphocytes in the bloodstream occurs in some species as a response to the secretion of epinephrine (a hormone also known as adrenaline). A reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes may be caused by hormones that may also be secreted in times of stress. Unusual lymphocytes may be seen in the blood in response to antigenic stimulation, such as vaccination.\nMalignant tumors originating in a lymph node (lymphoma) or lymphoid leukemia can also occur."

      "content": "Platelets are small, cell-like particles produced in the bone marrow and then released into the blood. They function to start the formation of blood clots. Platelets gather where bleeding occurs and clump together to form the initial plug that stops or slows the flow of blood. Platelets also release substances that are needed to complete the clotting process.\nPlatelet disorders can result from having too few or too many platelets or from impaired platelet function. In general, when platelet counts fall very low there is an increased risk of bleeding. Decreases in platelets may be caused by anti-platelet antibodies, drugs, toxins, or disorders of the bone marrow. Conditions that consume a large number of platelets (such as massive bleeding or severe clotting disorders) can also deplete platelet numbers. Finally, large numbers of platelets can become trapped in an enlarged spleen, decreasing the number of platelets in the blood.\nAn abnormal increase in the number of platelets is rare and often the cause is not known. It may be associated with bone marrow disease or with long-term blood loss and iron deficiency.\nThere are also disorders in which platelets do not function properly. Von Willebrand disease is one example. Other hereditary disorders of platelet function have been described but are rare. Probably the most common platelet function defect in animals is a side effect of aspirin. Do not give your dog aspirin—or any other medication—unless it is prescribed by your veterinarian.",

The most important of these is called Dog Erythrocyte Antigen (DEA) 1.1. Typing of blood donors and recipients is done before transfusion. Approximately 40% of dogs are positive for DEA 1.1, meaning that they have that antigen on their red blood cells. If a dog is DEA 1.1-negative and is given DEA 1.1-positive blood, it may develop antibodies that rapidly destroy the red blood cells if a second DEA 1.1-positive transfusion is given. By selecting donor animals that lack DEA 1.1 or that match the recipient, the risk of sensitizing the recipient can be minimized. A DEA 1.1-positive dog may receive either positive or negative blood.",

        "content": "Often, the need for a blood transfusion is an emergency, such as severe bleeding or sudden destruction of red blood cells due to other disease. Transfusions may also be needed to treat anemia. Animals with blood clotting disorders often require repeated transfusions of whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, or platelets. The most serious risk of transfusion is acute destruction of red blood cells, usually caused by a previously formed antibody to an antigen on the transfused red blood cells. Fortunately, this is rare. A more common problem in dogs that have received multiple transfusions is delayed destruction of the red blood cells, caused by antibodies to some of the minor blood group antigens.\nOther complications of transfusions include infection from contaminated blood, a decrease in blood calcium levels, and accumulation of fluid in the lungs as a result of giving too large a volume of blood. Skin hives, fever, or vomiting are seen occasionally. Fortunately most transfusions are safe and effective."

      "title": "Anemia in Dogs",
      "content": "Anemia occurs when there is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, which can be measured by red blood cell count or hemoglobin concentration. It can develop from loss, destruction, or lack of production of red blood cells. Anemia is classified as regenerative or nonregenerative. In a regenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds appropriately to the decreased number of red blood cells by increasing production of new blood cells. In a nonregenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds inadequately to the increased need for red blood cells. Anemias due to bleeding or the destruction of existing red blood cells are usually regenerative. Anemias that are caused by a decrease in the hormone that stimulates red blood cell production or by an abnormality in the bone marrow are nonregenerative.",
      "Signs and Diagnosis": {
        "title": "Signs and Diagnosis",
        "content": "The signs of anemia in animals depend on the severity, the duration (short or long-term), and the underlying cause of the illness. Sudden anemia can result in shock and even death if more than a third of the blood volume is lost rapidly and not replaced. After rapid blood loss, the animal usually has an increased heart rate, pale gums, and low blood pressure. The cause of the blood loss may be obvious, for example, a major injury. If no evidence of external bleeding is found, your veterinarian will look for a source of internal or hidden blood loss, for example, a ruptured tumor on the spleen, a stomach ulcer, a bleeding disorder, or parasites. If red blood cells are being destroyed, the animal may appear jaundiced (a yellowish color of the whites of the eyes, skin, or gums). Animals with long-term anemia have had time to adjust, and their signs are usually slower to develop. These include loss of energy, weakness, and loss of appetite. Affected animals will have similar physical examination findings, such as pale gums, an increased heart rate, and possibly enlargement of the spleen or a heart murmur.\nA complete medical history is an important part of diagnosing anemia. Questions a veterinarian may ask include how long signs have been present; if there is a history of exposure to toxins such as rodent poisons, heavy metals, or toxic plants; what drug treatments and vaccinations the pet has had; where the pet has traveled; and any prior illnesses.\nA complete blood count is another diagnostic tool your veterinarian will use to provide information on the severity of the anemia, the degree of bone marrow response, and the condition of other types of blood cells. A test should be performed to evaluate red blood cell size and shape and to check for red blood cell parasites (some of which are discussed later in this chapter).\nAdditional blood and urine tests can be used to evaluate how well the internal organs are functioning. If blood loss within the stomach or intestines is suspected, an examination of the animal’s feces under a microscope for trace amounts of blood and parasites can be useful. X-rays can help identify hidden disease, such as a penny in the stomach of a puppy leading to zinc poisoning and anemia. Bruising or bleeding may be signs of a disease or condition affecting the blood’s ability to clot and indicate the need for a test called a coagulation profile. If hemolytic disease (a condition in which there is destruction of red blood cells) is suspected, other tests can be performed. A blood test for infectious agents may also be helpful in defining the cause of anemia.\nBone marrow evaluation is typically done for any animal with an unexplained, nonregenerative anemia. Sampling the bone marrow requires sedation or anesthesia."

Obvious causes of severe loss include major injury or surgery. If the reason for blood loss is not apparent, your veterinarian will look for other causes, such as conditions affecting the blood’s ability to clot, bleeding tumors, stomach ulcers, or parasites. Internal parasites, such as hookworms in dogs, can lead to severe blood loss, especially in puppies. Low-grade, longterm blood loss eventually results in iron-deficiency anemia. This leads to abnormally small red blood cells and a lack of hemoglobin. In young animals this is often caused by parasites (for example, fleas, lice, or intestinal worms), but in older animals, bleeding from stomach ulcers or tumors is more common."

The body no longer recognizes red blood cells as self and develops antibodies to circulating red blood cells, leading to their destruction.\nDogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia are usually jaundiced, sometimes have a fever, and may have an enlarged spleen. They can show mild, slow-developing signs and not appear to be in any pain, or they can suddenly be in severe crisis. Your veterinarian will tailor treatment to the animal’s signs. Any underlying infections will be treated and unnecessary drug therapy discontinued. Intravenous fluid therapy may be started and supplemented with blood transfusions if necessary. Drugs are also given to suppress the immune system in order to stop the destruction of red blood cells.\nBlocking of a blood vessel in the lungs by a piece that has broken away from a blood clot (known as pulmonary thromboembolism) is a risk for dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The underlying cause is unknown, but the risk may be reduced by supportive care with fluids and blood transfusions. Fluids are important to keep kidneys functioning properly and to protect the kidneys from the high concentrations of circulating bilirubin (the reddish yellow pigments in blood that cause jaundice). If the risk for forming blood clots is high, anticoagulant medication may also be given.\nImmune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a serious medical condition that causes death in 20%-75% of affected animals. The risk of death depends on which signs are seen, but rapid drops in red blood cell counts, moderate to high white blood cell counts, abnormal bruising, and excessive clotting may indicate a higher risk.

The antibodies develop in the mother during unmatched blood transfusions. Newborns with neonatal isoerythrolysis are normal at birth but develop severe hemolytic anemia within 2 to 3 days and become weak and jaundiced. A veterinarian can perform tests to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of stopping all nursing from the mother, providing nutrition through a milk replacer, and, in some cases, giving blood transfusions.

The deficiencies most likely to cause anemia are iron, copper, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin E.\nIron deficiency is the most common deficiency seen in dogs. It is rarely nutritional in origin—it most commonly occurs after blood loss ( see Blood Loss Anemia). Young animals do not have much stored iron, and milk contains very little iron. Your veterinarian may recommend oral iron supplements for anemic newborns. Your veterinarian will also look for any hidden source of blood loss and treat it if needed.\nB vitamin deficiencies are rare. Some drugs, such as anticonvulsants and drugs that interfere with B vitamin metabolism, may cause anemia. Poor absorption of vitamin B12 has been reported in Giant Schnauzers.

          "content": "Bone marrow disease or failure from any cause can lead to nonregenerative anemia and a reduction in the number of all types of blood cells—red, white, and platelets. With widespread marrow involvement, white blood cells are affected first, followed by platelets, and finally red blood cells.\nAplastic anemia (anemia in which the ability of bone marrow to generate all blood cells is reduced) has been reported in dogs. Most cases have no known cause, but some are caused by infections, drug therapy, toxins, or total body irradiation. The immune system may also be involved in the development of this disease. The disease is diagnosed by taking a bone marrow sample. To treat the condition, the underlying cause must be determined and eliminated. Supportive care, such as antibiotics and transfusions, and medications that suppress the immune system may also be needed. Drugs that stimulate the bone marrow can be used until the marrow recovers. If the disease has no known cause or if marrow recovery is unlikely (for example, phenylbutazone poisoning in dogs), bone marrow transplantation is helpful if a suitable donor is available. However, bone marrow transplantation may not be available in all areas.\nIn pure red cell aplasia, only the red blood cells or the elements that produce the red blood cells are affected. It is characterized by a nonregenerative anemia with severe reduction of the elements that produce the red blood cells in the bone marrow. It has been reported in dogs. Cases that are immune-related often respond to therapy that suppresses the immune system. Supportive treatments, such as blood transfusions, may be indicated for severe cases. A synthetic hormone that stimulates blood cell production has been reported to cause pure red cell aplasia in some dogs. Stopping the hormone treatment may eventually lead to recovery in some animals.\nPrimary leukemias are a type of cancer in which abnormal white blood cells replace normal blood cells. This leads to anemia and a lack of normal white blood cells and platelets. Primary leukemias are uncommon, but they have been reported in dogs. Leukemias can develop in bone marrow or the lymphatic system and are classified as acute (sudden and often severe) or chronic (long-lasting, with signs that are generally less severe). Acute leukemias, in which the marrow is filled with immature blood cells, generally respond poorly to chemotherapy. In animals that do respond, remission times are usually short. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs, the response rate to chemotherapy for the most common type of acute leukemia is about 30%, with about half the dogs surviving for at least 4 months. Other types of acute leukemia are less common and even less responsive to treatment. Chronic leukemias, in which there is greatly increased production of one blood cell line, are less likely to cause anemia and are more responsive to treatment.\nMyelodysplasia (also called myelodysplastic syndrome) is a bone marrow disorder in which growth and maturation of blood-forming cells in the bone marrow is defective. This leads to nonregenerative anemia or shortages of white blood cells or platelets. It is considered a preleukemic syndrome (occurring before leukemia fully develops). Myelodysplasia occurs in dogs, cats, and humans. The disease can occur as the result of mutations in stem cells or be caused by tumors in other organs or drug therapy. Some dogs respond to treatment with synthetic hormones and steroids. Supportive care with transfusions may be helpful. Survival rates vary because myelodysplasia can progress to leukemia. Many animals with this condition are put to sleep or die of infection, bleeding, or anemia.\nMyelofibrosis causes bone marrow failure after normal marrow elements are replaced with fibrous (scar) tissue. It can be the initial disease or occur as a result of cancer, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia ( see Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia), whole body irradiation, or hereditary anemias. Diagnosis can be made by bone marrow biopsy, a procedure that requires anesthesia. Treatment depends on the underlying cause but usually involves suppressing the immune system. Because suppressing the immune system increases the chances that your pet will catch other diseases, carefully follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for controlling exposure to disease-causing agents."

This organism is transmitted by ticks, but its mode of transmission is unusual. The tick picks up the organism from an infected host while biting the animal. An uninfected dog gets the disease by eating the tick (or animals that ate a tick), not from being bitten by the tick. In most of the world, the protozoan Hepatozoon canis is transmitted by the brown dog tick, causing Old World hepatozoonosis. In North America, the signs in infected dogs are different and more severe than in other parts of the world, and the disease is caused by a different Hepatozoon species, which is now called Hepatozoon americanum. This species is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick instead of by the brown dog tick. Because of these differences, the disease in North America is referred to as American canine hepatozoonosis (see below).\nIn much of the world (India, Africa, southeast Asia, the Middle East, southern Europe, and islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans), infected dogs have no signs of infection or only mild signs. Having a suppressed immune system due to another disease appears to play an important role in the development of significant signs. In the United States, more severe signs may occur, even in dogs that do not have a suppressed immune system. Most cases in the US have been diagnosed in Texas (primarily along the Gulf Coast), Oklahoma, and Louisiana, but cases have also been reported as far east as Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. This is a recent disease that has primarily spread north and east from the Gulf Coast of Texas, where it was originally detected in 1978.\nDogs older than 4 to 6 months old are usually resistant to infection with H. canis.

Severe sensitivity or pain near the spine is also common, as are stiffness and a general reluctance to move. Eventually, hepatozoonosis may lead to inflammation of the kidneys or amyloidosis of the kidneys (a condition in which there is a buildup of an abnormal protein called amyloid in kidney tissues).\nMuscle biopsies are considered the best way to diagnose hepatozoonosis. Specific blood tests, visualizing infected blood cells, and x-rays may also help with diagnosis. Other laboratory findings may include a significant increase in the white blood cell count and a mild to moderate anemia.\nHepatozoonosis is a life-long infection in dogs. No known treatment completely clears the body of the organism. In the past, most dogs showed only temporary improvement, with frequent relapses within 3 to 6 months and death within 2 years of diagnosis. However, remission can now usually be achieved by using new drug combinations. These new therapies have resulted in a marked improvement in the outlook for dogs with hepatozoonosis.\nPrevention of access to ticks and preventing dogs from catching and eating prey are the most effective ways to control this disease. Be sure to provide your pet with good tick control, especially if you live in an area where this disease has been reported. Affected dogs should not be bred.

Tsetse flies are restricted to Africa; however, horseflies and other biting flies can transmit the disease in other locations (such as in Central and South America). In dogs, Trypanosoma brucei is most likely to cause disease. Domestic animals may be a source of human infections.\nInfected tsetse flies inject the protozoa into the skin of animals, where they grow for a few days and cause localized swellings called chancres. They enter the lymph nodes, then the bloodstream, where they multiply quickly. The immune response is very strong; however, not all trypanosomes are vulnerable to the immune response, which results in longterm infection.\nThe severity of disease varies with the species and age of the animal infected and the species of trypanosome involved. The incubation period is usually 1 to 4 weeks. The primary signs are fever, anemia, and weight loss. The eyes are often affected. Internally, the lymph nodes and spleen are usually swollen. The diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory testing to identify trypanosomes in the blood of an infected dog.\nSeveral drugs can be used for treatment; however, most drugs only work if the correct dose is given. It is very important to follow the prescribed dosage exactly. Some trypanosomes have become resistant to certain drugs, which may be the cause in cases that do not respond to medical treatment.\nThe risk of infection can be reduced in areas where the disease is common by keeping dogs indoors or by getting rid of tsetse flies and using preventive drugs, which are given to stop an infection from getting started. Flies can be partially controlled by using sprays or dips on the pets to be protected, spraying insecticides on fly-breeding areas, using screens coated with insecticide, and clearing brush to reduce the habitat for the flies. Animals can be given preventive drugs in areas of high risk for infections, but this is rarely undertaken in domestic dogs. There is no vaccine."

      "title": "Malignant Lymphoma in Dogs",
      "content": "Malignant lymphoma is a common cancer in dogs. It is a progressive, deadly disease caused by the harmful growth of lymphocytes. Lymphoma most commonly arises from lymphoid tissues in the bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, or spleen. Other common sites include the skin, eye, central nervous system, and bone. Although it is common, the causes and origin of the disease are not well understood. Possible causes or contributing factors include viral infection, environmental contamination with herbicides, magnetic field exposure, genetic abnormalities, and dysfunction of the immune system.\nThe signs, response to treatment, and outcome of canine lymphoma will vary depending on factors, such as tumor and patient characteristics, the part of the body involved, and the extent of the disease. Most types of lymphoma are high-grade and involve T cells or B cells. In dogs, lymphoma has been classically characterized by body locations in which they occur: 1) multicentric, which originates in multiple places; 2) alimentary, which occurs in the digestive system, 3) mediastinal, which occurs within the chest; and 4) extranodal, which may involve the kidneys, central nervous system, or skin.\nMulticentric lymphoma is by far the most common form, accounting for about 80%-85% of cases. An early sign of multicentric lymphoma is the rapid and nonpainful enlargement of lymph nodes, which may become 3 to 10 times their normal size. In addition to this, cancerous lymphocytes may move into internal organs including the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other sites. Late in the course of disease, when there are multiple, large tumors, dogs may show general signs of illness, including lack of energy, weakness, fever, loss of appetite, and dehydration.\nAlimentary lymphoma is much less common and accounts for less than 10% of all canine lymphomas. Dogs with this form of the disease may have signs related to stomach upset, such as vomiting and abdominal pain. When the disease affects most of the intestinal tract, dogs may have devastating signs, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and continued weight loss because they cannot digest food properly.\nMediastinal lymphoma is also uncommon. Dogs with this form of the disease may have an enlarged thymus, lymph nodes, or both. As the disease advances, signs may include trouble breathing as fluid builds up in the chest and puts pressure on the lungs. The tumor may block the vein that routes blood from the upper part of the body into the heart. In addition to signs related to breathing, some dogs with mediastinal lymphoma pass large amounts of urine and drink more than normal. This can be caused by an increase in calcium in the blood, a syndrome seen in 10% to 40% of dogs with lymphoma.\nThe medical problems associated with extranodal lymphoma vary and depend on which organ is affected. Skin lymphoma may appear as single, raised, slow-healing sores or widespread, scaly regions. Signs of lymphoma at other extranodal sites include difficulty breathing (lungs), kidney failure (kidneys), blindness (eyes), seizures (central nervous system), and bone fractures and pain (bone).\nAlthough most cases of lymphoma are high-grade cancers of B cells and T cells, a low-grade form occurs up to 30% of the time. These tumors develop slowly, and dogs may not show any signs of the disease.\nCanine lymphoma is often relatively easy to diagnose by taking a small sample of tissue or cells from the affected organ system. In dogs with multicentric lymphoma, a needle biopsy of enlarged lymph nodes usually provides enough cells to confirm the diagnosis. Specialized tests can then help determine the type of lymphoma, which cell types are affected, and the expected outcome.",
      "Treatment and Outlook": {
        "title": "Treatment and Outlook",
        "content": "Treatment of high-grade, multicentric canine lymphoma with chemotherapy using a combination of drugs is often successful, with more than 90% of all dogs achieving complete remission (a complete reduction of tumors). Individual treatment plans vary with respect to the drugs used, dosage, and frequency and duration of treatment. With chemotherapy, the expected survival time for dogs with B-cell lymphoma is about 12 months. For dogs with T-cell lymphoma, expected survival times are shorter (6 months). Dogs that do not respond to the usual drugs may improve when other treatment plans are used. These alternate plans may include other drugs or radiation. In recent years, treatment has included both initial and longterm medications. Now, similar or improved responses are seen with shorter term therapies, and chemotherapy is often stopped once remission is reached. Bone marrow transplants may even be an option for some dogs.\nTreating other forms of lymphoma is often more difficult. Alimentary lymphoma, if concentrated in one area, can be treated effectively with surgery to remove the tumor, together with combination chemotherapy. However, if lymphoma is spread throughout the intestinal tract, the response to treatment is not as good and survival times are shorter (often less than 3 months). The use of combination chemotherapy with or without radiation can give dogs with mediastinal lymphoma considerable improvement in survival times and quality-of-life scores. Dogs with an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood, a condition often associated with mediastinal lymphoma, are also less likely to live for long. Lymphoma involving other extranodal sites, such as the skin, can be managed with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as appropriate; however, the disease often stops responding to treatment. Dogs with low-grade lymphoma tend to do well and with chemotherapy can survive longer than two years."

    "content": {
      "title": "Bleeding Disorders of Dogs",
      "content": "When bleeding occurs in an organ or body part, a process is set in motion to stop the bleeding. This is called hemostasis. In order to work, hemostasis requires an adequate number of platelets, the right amount of blood clotting proteins (often referred to as factors), and blood vessels that constrict properly. When an injury occurs, the wall of the blood vessel breaks. A normally responsive blood vessel will narrow so that blood flows more slowly, allowing the clotting process to begin. Platelets also rush to the broken wall where certain proteins change the platelets’ shape from round to spiny so that they can stick to blood cells, the broken vessel wall, and to each other. Other proteins form long strands called fibrin. These fibrin strands form a net that traps and helps hold together the platelets and blood cells, creating a clot that plugs the break in the vessel wall. After the clot has formed and stabilized, other proteins stop the clotting process and eventually dissolve the clot.\nBleeding disorders may be present at birth (congenital) or occur later (acquired). Defects in blood clotting proteins usually show up as delayed bleeding and bruising deep in tissues, while platelet defects usually show up as superficial small bruises, nosebleeds, black stools caused by bleeding into the bowels, or prolonged bleeding at injection and surgery sites.\nAbnormal clotting (also called hypercoagulation) leading to blocked arteries may be inherited disorders of anticlotting proteins or acquired disorders. Acquired clotting diseases are more common in animals than are inherited disorders.\nBlood clotting tests can help identify animals with defective clotting proteins. However, the tests are not very sensitive, so an animal must have a severe deficiency for the tests to find the problem. Newer tests may provide more information, but they are not widely available.",
      "Congenital Clotting Protein Disorders": {
        "title": "Congenital Clotting Protein Disorders",
        "content": "Many different proteins are involved in the clotting process. Deficiencies of any of these proteins can cause bleeding disorders. Congenital clotting protein disorders are present at birth. In a severe deficiency or defect of clotting proteins, signs will appear at an early age. Severe defects are usually deadly. Animals may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. Lack of clotting proteins or vitamin K (which is also part of the clotting process) in a newborn animal may make a clotting defect worse. If the amount of any particular clotting protein is 5 to 10% of normal, the newborn may survive, but will usually show signs of illness before 6 months of age. It is during this time, when numerous routine procedures (for example, vaccination, dewclaw removal, and neutering or spaying) are usually done, that a bleeding tendency may be noticed by your veterinarian. Most of the clotting protein disorders present at birth in domestic animals are defects of a single protein.\nHypofibrinogenemia (an abnormal shortage of fibrinogen in the blood), accompanied by severe bleeding, has been reported in Saint Bernards and Vizslas. Dysfibrinogenemia (abnormally functioning fibrinogen) has been reported in an inbred family of Russian Wolfhounds (Borzois). Dogs with the disorder had mild bleeding problems (such as nosebleeds), but injury or surgery resulted in life-threatening bleeding. Intravenous transfusion with fresh or fresh-frozen plasma (the liquid portion of blood) is the best treatment to stop the bleeding.\nFactor II (prothrombin) disorders are rare. Prothrombin is one of the proteins that plays a role in clotting of blood. Boxer dogs have been reported to have prothrombin that is present in normal amounts in the body but does not function normally. A disorder of Factor II has been reported in English Cocker Spaniels. Signs in affected puppies, such as nosebleeds and bleeding gums, decrease with age. Adults bruise easily or have inflamed skin. Treatment is by transfusion of whole blood or plasma.\nDeficiency of Factor VII, another clotting protein, has been reported in Beagles, English Bulldogs, Alaskan Malamutes, Alaskan Klee Kai, Miniature Schnauzers, Boxers, and mixed-breed dogs. Usually, it is not associated with sudden, unexplained bleeding, but affected dogs may have bruising or excessive bleeding after surgery. Prolonged bleeding after giving birth has been reported. Factor VII deficiency is most often diagnosed coincidentally when clotting tests are performed.\nHemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs. Usually, females carry the gene for the disease without showing any signs, while males do show signs. In affected puppies, prolonged bleeding is seen from the umbilical cord after birth, from the gums during teething, and after surgery. Lameness due to bleeding into a joint, sudden clot formation, and oozing of blood in the body cavity also are common signs in dogs with less than 5% of normal Factor VIII activity. Animals with 5 to 10% of normal activity typically do not bleed spontaneously but bleed more than usual after an injury or surgery. Small dogs may be less likely to show signs of illness. Carrier animals have higher levels of Factor VIII (40 to 60% of normal), and the results of their clotting tests are usually normal. The diagnosis is harder to confirm in animals less than 6 months old because their livers may not yet have produced enough of the clotting proteins. Treatment requires repeated transfusions of whole blood or plasma until bleeding has been controlled.\nHemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) is less common than hemophilia A. It has been reported in several breeds of purebred dogs and a mixed-breed dog. Females are usually carriers and rarely have signs of the disease. Signs are similar to those of hemophilia A. Animals with extremely low Factor IX activity (less than 1% of normal) usually die at birth or shortly thereafter. Animals with 5 to 10% of normal Factor IX activity may suddenly develop blood clots, bleeding in the joints, oozing of blood in the body cavity, or organ bleeding. Gums may bleed excessively during teething. Some animals have no signs until injury or surgery. Carrier animals with 40 to 60% of normal Factor IX activity usually have no signs and normal results on blood clotting tests. Treatment requires transfusion with fresh or fresh-frozen plasma. Often, internal bleeding into the abdomen, chest, central nervous system, or muscles occurs, and may not be noticed until a crisis happens.\nCongenital clotting protein disorders involving deficiencies of Factor X, Factor XI, Factor XII, and prekallikrein have been reported in a few dogs but appear to be extremely rare. Finally, poor clot strength has caused bleeding after surgery in some Greyhounds."

        "title": "Acquired Clotting Protein Disorders",
        "content": "Most clotting proteins are produced in the liver. Therefore, liver disease can lead to decreased levels of clotting proteins, particularly Factors VII, IX, X, and XI, and proteins that break up clots. Severe liver disease can also lead to a condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (see below). Fibrinogen, the protein in blood that is made in the liver and converted to fibrin in response to tissue damage, and von Willebrand’s factor, which is produced outside the liver and helps platelets stick to the blood vessel wall and to each other, can be increased in liver disease.\nDogs that eat rat poison may have blood clotting problems because the poison reduces the liver’s production of clotting proteins. Affected animals may have blood clots and bruising of superficial and deep tissues. Often, the animals do not bleed within the first 24 hours after eating the poison. Vitamin K1, given by injection and then by mouth, is the usual treatment, but may cause side effects, including anemia or allergic reactions. If you suspect your dog has eaten any type of rat or mouse poison, this is an emergency and an immediate trip to your veterinarian is appropriate.\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream, blocking small blood vessels and consuming the platelets and clotting factors needed to control bleeding. It usually develops after a triggering event, such as severe infection, heat stroke, burn, tumor, or severe injury. In many cases, the signs are uncontrolled bleeding and the inability to form a normal clot. Death is caused by extensive blood clots or collapse of circulation, leading to the failure of one or several organs. Your veterinarian will determine and attempt to correct the underlying problem causing this condition. Intravenous fluids are extremely important for maintaining normal circulation. The underlying cause must be treated promptly, and anti-clotting drugs may be necessary. DIC is a very serious disorder and is often fatal. Chances of survival are increased with an earlier diagnosis, but early diagnosis can be difficult and requires specialized testing."

Mild to severe platelet shortages can be seen, and excessive bleeding is a potential complication. This disorder is deadly; most dogs with the disease die from infections before 6 months of age. Even dogs that receive frequent antibiotic treatments usually die by 3 years of age from amyloidosis, a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in the body’s organs. Treatment with proteins that stimulate the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow may provide temporary—but not longterm—improvement.\nHereditary macrothrombocytopenia occurs in about 50% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. These dogs have a decreased number of platelets with the presence of giant platelets. This benign (harmless) condition is discovered on routine blood screens."

          "content": "Acquired thrombocytopenias are common in dogs. Many causes have been identified, most involving the immune system destroying platelets.\nRickettsial diseases, caused by organisms in the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, cause mild to severe loss of platelets in dogs. Infection may include short- and longterm changes in the number of platelets and other blood cells. Ticks are the usual carriers of the infection. Infected dogs may show no signs or may have nosebleeds, bleeding into the bowels (resulting in black stools), bleeding of the gums, and prolonged bleeding after vaccination or surgery.\nThrombocytopenia due to immune system dysfunction occurs when the immune system makes antibodies that destroy platelets or platelet-producing cells in the bone marrow. Signs include tiny, purplish red spots on the gums or skin (called petechiae), bruising, bleeding into the bowels resulting in black stools, or nosebleeds. An evaluation of the bone marrow may be necessary to help determine if circulating platelets or the platelet-forming cells are targeted by the antibodies. Corticosteroids are the usual treatment, although other drugs are sometimes used. A blood transfusion may be necessary for anemic dogs. Affected animals should rest to help prevent injuries and abnormal bleeding. If an animal has repeated episodes of the disease, the spleen is sometimes removed.\nThrombocytopenia caused by vaccination has been reported in dogs that have been vaccinated repeatedly with certain types of vaccines (modified live adenovirus or paramyxovirus vaccines). The platelet loss occurs 3 to 10 days after repeat vaccination, usually lasts for only a short time, and may be so mild that it is not noticed unless it happens at the same time as another clotting disorder. Studies have not shown an association between vaccination and immune-mediated destruction of platelets; however, it may rarely occur.\nThrombocytopenia caused by drugs has been reported in dogs. Some drugs and classes of drugs (including estrogen and some antibiotics) suppress the production of platelets in the bone marrow. Other drugs (including aspirin, acetaminophen, penicillin, and others) destroy platelets circulating in the bloodstream. Drug reactions are rare and unpredictable. Platelets usually return to normal shortly after the drug is discontinued. Drug-induced bone marrow suppression may last longer, however. If your dog is taking one of these drugs, your veterinarian will likely monitor the blood count to check for any serious reductions in the number of platelets.\nThrombocytopenia caused by cancer can occur in dogs. Certain types of cancers can trigger a condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation ( see Acquired Clotting Protein Disorders,), which destroys many platelets. Some cancers can also stimulate the immune system and inflammation to consume platelets. Abnormal bleeding can also occur in cancer patients due to abnormal platelet function and inflammation of blood vessels."

Affected dogs have nosebleeds, tiny purplish red spots (petechiae), and bleeding of the gums. This disorder should be suspected in Basset Hounds that have these signs, along with normal levels of platelets and von Willebrand’s factor. Specific diagnosis of this disorder requires specialized platelet function testing. There is no specific treatment, but in cases of severe bleeding, plasma or whole blood transfusions may be needed.\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia, previously called thrombasthenic thrombopathia, has been diagnosed in Otterhounds and Great Pyrenees dogs. Affected dogs have prolonged bleeding times and form large bruises easily. A large number of oddly shaped, giant platelets are seen in blood tests. Platelets from dogs with this disorder do not clump together or separate as they normally should. There is no specific treatment. In cases of severe bleeding, transfusions of plasma or whole blood can be given.\nVon Willebrand disease is caused by a defective or deficient von Willebrand’s factor. Von Willebrand factor is the protein that carries an important clotting factor (Factor VIII) in the blood and that regulates the first step in clot formation. It is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs and occurs in nearly all breeds and in mixed breeds. The disorder is most common in Doberman Pinschers, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Miniature Schnauzers, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Shetland Sheepdogs, Basset Hounds, Scottish Terriers, Standard Poodles, and Standard Manchester Terriers.\nThree types of von Willebrand disease are known. The most common, Type 1, occurs in dogs with low von Willebrand factor and results in mild to moderate signs. Dogs with Type 2 also have a low amount of the factor but have moderate to severe signs. The factor is absent in dogs with Type 3, which is most frequently seen in Shetland Sheepdogs and Scottish Terriers. Signs include bleeding of the gums, nosebleeds, and blood in the urine. Some puppies may bleed excessively only after injection or surgery. Signs of von Willebrand disease are similar to those of platelet disorders or thrombocytopenia. Laboratory tests are required to confirm the diagnosis. Active bleeding episodes may require transfusion with whole blood or plasma.

Certain diseases in animals have been associated with increased risk of blood clots. These have been seen in dogs with kidney disease, overactive adrenal glands, cancer, longterm decrease in the production of thyroid hormones, and rarely, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia ( see Hemolytic Anemia).\nSome kidney diseases cause a decrease in the anticlotting protein called antithrombin III. Other abnormalities found in kidney disease include an increased tendency for platelets to clump together and a decrease in the enzyme that dissolves blood clots. Increased blood clotting is thought to be caused by several different factors.\nHaving too much cholesterol in the blood has been associated with increased risk of blood clots. Diseases that cause this include an increase in adrenal gland activity, diabetes, kidney disease, deficiency of thyroid hormones, and inflammation of the pancreas. All have been associated with increased risk of blood clot formation, often in the lungs.\nThe best treatment for an animal with blood clots is to diagnose and treat the underlying disease, along with providing good supportive care. Maintaining blood flow to the tissues is critical. Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to dissolve or prevent clots. In other cases, transfusions may be the most effective treatment."

Erythrocytosis can be relative, transient, or absolute.\nRelative erythrocytosis occurs when a decrease in the volume of plasma (the liquid part of blood) results in an apparent increase in red blood cell numbers. Relative polycythemia can be caused by anything that causes fluid loss from the blood, such as dehydration from vomiting or diarrhea. Treatment consists of giving fluids to the animal and addressing the underlying cause.\nTransient erythrocytosis is a type of relative polycythemia that occurs when excitement or fear causes the spleen to contract, resulting in the release of large numbers of red blood cells into the circulation.\nAbsolute erythrocytosis is a real increase in red blood cell numbers resulting from increased production. This can be due to a bone marrow disorder in the case of primary erythrocytosis (polycythemia vera) or caused by excessive release of hormones that stimulate red blood cell production (secondary erythrocytosis). Signs of the disorder include red mucous membranes, bleeding tendencies, the passing of large amounts of urine, excessive thirst, seizures or behavioral changes, lack of coordination, weakness, and blindness.\nDiagnosis requires measuring the percentage of red blood cells in the blood, a simple test available in most veterinary clinics. Repeated tests should be normal in dogs with relative and transient erythrocytosis; however, Greyhounds and other Sighthounds have higher percentages of red blood cells compared to other breeds. Your veterinarian will use other blood and urine tests to distinguish between primary and secondary erythrocytosis. In some cases, x-rays and other tests may also be required.",

      "content": "Bones provide rigid structure to the body and shield internal organs from damage. They also house bone marrow, where blood cells are formed, and they maintain the body’s reservoirs of calcium and phosphorus. Old bone tissue is constantly replaced with new bone tissue in a process called remodeling. This helps keep the bones healthy.\nBones come together to form joints. The type of joint formed determines the degree and direction of motion. For example, joints with a ball-and-socket formation allow for rotation, while hinge joints only allow bending and straightening. Some joints do not move at all. In a joint, the ends of the bones are covered with cartilage, which is a smooth protective tissue that helps reduce friction as joints move.\nSkeletal muscles are responsible for posture and movement. They are attached to bones and arranged around the joints.\nTendons are tough bands of connective tissue made up mostly of a protein called collagen. They do not stretch. Tendons attach each end of a muscle to a bone. They are located within sheaths that allow them to move easily. Ligaments are also tough cords formed of connective tissue. Ligaments surround joints and help to support and stabilize them. They also connect one bone to another."

      "title": "Overview of Musculoskeletal Disorders and Diseases in Dogs",
      "content": "Diseases of the musculoskeletal system most often affect the dog’s ability to move. How severely movement is impaired depends on the type and severity of the problem. Skeletal and joint disorders are the most common, but problems in the musculoskeletal system can also indicate diseases of the muscles, neurologic problems, toxins in the body, hormonal abnormalities, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, blood and vascular disorders, poor nutrition, and birth defects.\nDisorders that primarily affect the muscle membrane or muscle fibers are called myopathies. Muscle membrane disorders may be hereditary or acquired. Myopathies involving the actual muscle fiber components include polymyositis as well as exertional myopathy. Diagnosing a myopathy usually requires laboratory tests.\nTendons do not stretch, so they are prone to injury and may become torn if a large amount of force is applied to them. Such injuries lead to tendinitis, which is inflammation of the tendons. Because tendons and ligaments are relatively poorly supplied with blood, they heal slowly and sometimes imperfectly. Injuries to ligaments and tendons require patience and careful longterm rehabilitation. Healed tendons are not as strong and are prone to future injuries.\nSome bone diseases are present at birth (hereditary) or the result of nutritional deficiencies or injuries. Inherited disorders include some cases of canine hip dysplasia or having extra toes (polydactyly). An imbalanced level of minerals in the diet, particularly of trace minerals such as copper, zinc, and magnesium, is a common dietary cause of bone defects. Growing animals that are fed too much protein or have improper balance of calcium and phosphorus can also develop nutritional disorders affecting bones. Getting either too much or too little of certain vitamins, particularly vitamins A and D, can influence bone growth and development.\nMost bone disorders stem from some sort of trauma, such as fractures or cracks. Infections that cause bone tissue to break down and die can lead to bone disorders. In other situations, diseases of the ligaments or tendons may cause secondary bone troubles.\nJoint disorders may be caused by trauma to the joint, longterm inflammation, developmental problems, or infections. Traumatic injuries may produce short-term consequences such as dislocation, fracture, or the distortion (instability) of a joint. More longterm effects may include arthritis or the rupture of nearby ligaments or membranes.\nChronic or longterm inflammation is most commonly seen in joints associated with movement. The effects of longterm inflammation can be complicated. Any joint injury changes the composition and amount of fluid inside the joint, which affects the amount of pressure on the connecting bones.\nRecent years have seen great advances in techniques for diagnosing and healing musculoskeletal disorders. When detected early, the disorders often can be corrected, and a full return to healthy life is possible."

It is caused in most cases by deficiencies or imbalances of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and the hormone that regulates them (parathyroid hormone), all of which are important in creating and maintaining strong, healthy bones.\nThe primary source of calcium and phosphorus is the diet, but a number of factors affect how the body absorbs calcium and phosphorus. These include the source of the minerals as well as the levels of vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D is obtained either through the diet or by exposure to sunlight. Because of the role it plays in the body, if the vitamin or its activity is decreased, calcium and phosphorus absorption are reduced. Abnormalities of the bones can result, as well as other nutritional and metabolic complications.\nIn general, supplementing a dog’s diet with too much calcium or phosphorus can increase its susceptibility to diseases to which it is genetically prone. Specifically, giant-breed dogs fed excess calcium are more likely to develop osteochondrosis ( Osteochondrosis) and hypertrophic osteodystrophy ( Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy).",

More rarely, calcium deficiency is to blame. An excess of calcium has caused rickets-like signs in some dogs. As in most diets causing defective bone formation (osteodystrophies), the cause is typically an imbalance in the ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the diet. Animals fed all-meat diets commonly develop rickets.\nSigns may include bone pain and swelling, a stiff gait or limp, difficulty in rising, bowed limbs, and fractures. Affected puppies may become quiet and reluctant to play. Touching the bones will cause pain, and folding fractures of long bones and vertebrae are common. In folding fractures, pressure on the bones causes them to slowly “fold” over and deform instead of fracturing. X-rays will show distortions in the bone. In advanced cases, limbs can be deformed due to the bones growing at unequal rates.\nThe outlook for treating rickets is good if there are no broken bones or irreversible damage to the bone. The primary treatment is to correct the diet. Exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet radiation) will also increase the production of vitamin D.\nStudies show that many homemade diets for dogs are deficient in minerals and fail to achieve a proper calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. Therefore a high-quality commercial food, or one designed by a credentialed veterinary nutritionist, is recommended."

Because bones mature at different rates, both rickets and osteomalacia can be seen in the same animal.\nAffected animals may fail to thrive and may crave and eat substances such as paint chips, clay, plaster, or dirt. Fractures are most commonly found in the ribs, pelvis, and long bones (such as the main bones of the front and hind legs). Deformities may also be seen in the spine, including an abnormal inward curving of the spine in the lower area of the back (lordosis) or an abnormal outward curving of the spine (kyphosis).\nTo establish a firm diagnosis, veterinarians will evaluate a dog’s diet to make sure it provides enough calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D for healthy bones. X‑rays will reveal the effects of severe osteomalacia on the skeleton.\nAffected animals should be confined for the first few weeks while the diet is corrected. The response to proper nutrition is rapid. Within 1 week the animals become more active and show an improved attitude. Jumping or climbing must be prevented because the skeleton is still susceptible to fractures. Restrictions can usually be relaxed after 3 weeks, but confinement with limited movement is recommended until the skeleton returns to normal. Response to treatment can be monitored using x-rays."

          "content": "In primary hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid gland produces too much parathyroid hormone. This hormone controls the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus in the body. The disease occurs infrequently in older dogs.\nWhen too much parathyroid hormone is released over a long period of time, minerals are leached from the skeleton and replaced by immature fibrous connective tissue. This condition, called fibrous osteodystrophy, affects the entire skeleton but tends to concentrate in the bones of the skull.\nDogs with primary hyperparathyroidism may become lame and develop fractures of the long bones after minor physical trauma. Compression fractures in the spine place pressure on the spinal cord, which may disable motor and sensory functions. In some cases the condition causes a thickening of facial bones. Nasal cavities may be damaged and teeth loosened. Some dogs lose the ability to close the mouth properly and develop slow-healing sores in the gums. Often the jaw-bones become coarsely thickened, while bones in the skull grow thin and appear “moth-eaten” in x-rays. The name “rubber jaw” syndrome refers to advanced cases in which the jaw can be twisted gently due to the degeneration of the bone.\nTests on animals with primary hyperparathyroidism will show an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood. Other tests can be performed to determine phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels. Because abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood may be associated with many other diseases, an animal must be thoroughly examined before confirming a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism.\nThe goal of treatment is to eliminate the source of excessive parathyroid hormone production. If a tumor is causing the increased parathyroid hormone levels, it must be removed. If high levels of calcium persist a week or longer after surgery or recur after initial improvement, a second tumor or the spread of cancer from a malignant tumor may be causing the problem."

This type is more common than primary hyperparathyroidism ( see Primary Hyperparathyroidism). With progressive kidney disease, excess phosphate in the blood lowers calcium levels. The lowered calcium level in turn triggers an increase in parathyroid hormone levels. In addition, the kidneys are necessary to produce the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol). Too little calcitriol leads to further increases in parathyroid hormone levels.\nSigns of hyperparathyroidism caused by kidney disease include the most common signs of kidney malfunction (vomiting, dehydration, excessive thirst and urination, and depression). Physical changes to the skeleton vary with the level of kidney malfunction from minor to severe. Severely defective fibrous bone formation may accompany advanced kidney failure. Excessive growth or thickening of bone tissue, such as facial swelling, may be seen in younger dogs.\nWhile the entire skeleton may be affected, more dramatic changes are visible in the bones of the skull, particularly in the jaw. Jawbones become softened and pliable (known as “rubber jaw” syndrome). During early stages, the teeth may loosen and fall out, or interfere with chewing. The condition may prevent the proper closure of the jaw, resulting in drooling and causing the dog’s tongue to stick out. Long bones are less dramatically affected, but lameness, stiff gait, and fractures after minor trauma may occur.\nThis type of hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed when laboratory test results show abnormalities consistent with kidney malfunction. Lab work will also reveal increased levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood.\nTreatment options include modifying the diet, supplementing it with active vitamin D (calcitriol), and giving medication that binds phosphate. Any underlying kidney disease must be managed as well. Prescription diets with restricted dietary phosphorus are available. Your veterinarian can give you specific recommendations for proper treatment options for your pet. Be sure to follow those recommendations and any prescriptions precisely as directed."

This, in turn, affects the levels of calcium and phosphorus. Smaller breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers are particularly susceptible, but other breeds may be affected.\nVarious disorders can disable the secretion of parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid glands may be damaged or inadvertently removed during thyroid surgery. If adequate tissue remains, however, glands will often regenerate following damage, eliminating the signs. Inflammation of the parathyroid glands, throat cancer, and canine distemper virus can also cause hypoparathyroidism. Rarely, the parathyroid glands fail to form in some puppies.\nAffected dogs are restless, nervous, and unable to control muscle movements. They may appear weak and have intermittent tremors that become convulsions. Longterm hypoparathyroidism can also cause abnormal hardening of certain parts of the body (such as ligaments), decreased mental function, cataracts, and reduction in bone volume.\nTo diagnose this disorder, a veterinarian will look for signs and the results of laboratory tests. Blood tests may show lowered calcium levels and higher than normal phosphorus levels. How well an animal responds to treatment may affect the diagnosis.\nThe prolonged contraction of muscles should be treated initially by restoring blood calcium levels to near normal. A veterinarian can accomplish this by giving calcium gluconate through the vein. Longterm maintenance of blood calcium levels is necessary if parathyroid hormone secretion is impaired. This can be attempted with a diet high in calcium, low in phosphorus, and supplemented with calcium and vitamin D3. Your veterinarian will be able to advise you as to the appropriate treatment options."

Surgery is generally beneficial if recommended and performed correctly. Dogs that do not undergo surgery may require lifestyle changes in order to be comfortable.\nBecause dogs can pass hip dysplasia to their puppies, at-risk breeds should be evaluated for hip dysplasia prior to breeding.

Displacement of the kneecap is often associated with multiple deformities of the hindlimb, involving the hip joint, femur, and tibia. The condition can also lead to cartilage and ligament injuries in the knee. Affected animals are lame or walk with a skipping gait. Dogs of any age may be affected.\nSigns vary widely based on the severity of the displacement. In mild cases, the kneecap can be manually displaced but easily returned to normal position. These cases show infrequent and mild signs. As displacement becomes more severe, the dislocated kneecap is more often out of place, the limb is consistently lame, and bone deformities may be seen. X-rays can help your veterinarian see how severely the kneecap is displaced and what effects this has had on the limb.\nThere are several surgical options for treatment. The type of surgery performed is based on the severity of the displacement and can include minor procedures and bone surgeries. Mild or moderately affected dogs generally recover fully."

        "title": "Osteochondrosis",
        "content": "Osteochondrosis is a disturbance in cartilage and bone formation of medium and large dogs that grow quickly. In this condition, the immature joint cartilage cracks and separates from the underlying bone. Fluid enters the space, and cysts may form under the cartilage. Fragments of cartilage may separate from the end of a bone and float loose in the joint cavity. This results in inflammation of the affected joint, and it can lead to arthritis and continued cartilage breakdown, severely affecting joint motion. The cause is unknown, but possible factors include high-growth diets, as well as rapid growth, trauma, and heredity.\nSigns of osteochondrosis include lameness, fluid buildup within the joint, and joint stiffness. Affected areas include the head of the humerus (shoulder joint), the inside of the elbow joint, the stifle (knee) joints, and the ridges of the hock (ankle) joints. Your veterinarian may use x-rays to determine the extent of the damage. Surgery using an endoscope (arthrography) can also be performed to identify cartilage or joint lesions. A computed tomography (CT) scan can also identify bone changes.\nTreatment involves surgical removal of cartilage flaps or the free-floating fragments of cartilage (\"joint mice\"). Dogs with degenerative joint disease may benefit from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and joint fluid modifiers. Your veterinarian is best able to advise you on the appropriate use of any relevant medication. The outlook for recovery is excellent for the shoulders, good for the stifle joint, and fair for the elbow and hock (tarsal) joints. If the affected dog also has signs of degenerative joint disease, other joint conditions, or instability of the hock joint, the chances of recovery are reduced."

        "content": "Elbow dysplasia is an abnormal development of the elbow joint in young, large, rapidly growing dogs. It involves abnormal bone growth, cartilage development, or joint stresses. It is considered to be one of the most common causes of osteoarthritis of the canine elbow.\nLameness can develop slowly between 4 and 8 months of age; however, some cases may not be diagnosed until the dogs are more than 1 year old. The joint may appear stiff or unable to move freely. Advanced cases develop osteoarthritis, fluid buildup within the joint, and a grating or crackling sound. Physical examination and the presence of the characteristic signs suggest the diagnosis, and x-rays can confirm it. Both elbows should be examined because the condition can develop in both at the same time.\nSurgery should be performed before the degenerative changes of osteoarthritis occur. The outlook for recovery after surgery is good if degenerative joint disease has not developed in the joint. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (as prescribed by your veterinarian) can reduce pain and inflammation. Joint fluid modifiers may also be helpful."

Rheumatoid arthritis and Greyhound polyarthritis are examples of arthritis that destroys joint cartilage and bone beneath the cartilage. Systemic lupus erythematosus is the most common form of immune-mediated arthritis.\nSigns include lameness, pain, and swelling in multiple joints, fever, a generalized illness, and loss of appetite. These signs commonly come and go. In addition to signs, the diagnosis is aided by x-rays, biopsy of joint tissue, blood tests, and examination of joint fluid (commonly called a joint tap).\nTreatment involves anti-inflammatory medications and chemotherapeutic agents.

          "content": "Tearing of the cranial cruciate ligament of the stifle (knee) joint is a very common injury in dogs. However injuries are more likely to occur when the joint structure is already weakened by degeneration, the animal’s own immune system, or defects in conformation (such as those seen in straight-legged dogs). A tear of this type can make the knee joint unstable and can lead to cartilage injury, buildup of joint fluid, bony outgrowths, and hardening and thickening of the joint membrane.\nSigns include those generally seen in joint disorders, such as lameness, pain, joint swelling, fluid buildup, and a grating sound when the joint is moved. In addition, the joint may appear to be abnormally loose. Partial cranial crucial ligament tears are characterized by a reduced ability to move the joint, especially bending it. Cartilage injury may be identified by a clicking sound during movement or when the joint is bent and extended. Veterinarians perform special tests during orthopedic exams to identify torn cruciate ligaments. X-rays are taken to evaluate the condition and anatomic angle of the joint, to aid treatment planning.\nBoth medical and surgical treatment options are available. Physical therapy, weight reduction, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ease discomfort from inflammation and degenerative joint disease. For active dogs, surgery to stabilize the knee joint is recommended. Physical therapy following surgery is critical for recovery. The outlook after surgery is good as long as degenerative joint disease has not progressed too far."

In young animals, the portion of the bone where growth occurs—called the growth plate and usually located at the ends of the bones—is weak compared with adjacent bones, ligaments, and joint membranes, making this area more prone to injury.\nSigns of joint fractures include lameness, pain, and joint swelling. If the injury affects an active growth plate, limb deformities can result. X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans are used to confirm and locate the fracture.\nThe goal of treatment is to allow the fracture to heal in proper alignment while maintaining joint and limb functions. This is usually done by holding the fracture in place internally with pins, wires, or screws in order to stabilize it. The outlook for recovery is good as long as damage to the joint is not severe."

The most common primary bone tumor is osteosarcoma of the radius, humerus, femur, or tibia.\nSigns include lameness, bone swelling, and fractures of the bone that are not caused by injury. X-rays of the affected limb can help confirm the diagnosis. Chest x-rays should be performed to look for any original tumors that may be spreading to the lungs. A bone biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis.\nThe outlook for long-term survival is guarded, but treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy can prolong the dog’s life in the short term."

        "title": "Bone Fractures",
        "content": "Bone fractures are often caused by car accidents, firearms, fights, or falls. Fractures can involve single or multiple breaks in the bone and may be open (also called compound) or closed. Open fractures have a wound or break in the skin that is associated with the fracture; closed fractures are those that do not produce an open wound. The shape and severity of the fracture depends on the force and type of the trauma. See also heading on page Introduction to Emergencies\nSigns of fracture usually include lameness, pain, and swelling. X-rays are useful in determining the type and extent of the fracture. Treatment is based on the type of fracture, the dog’s age and health, the owner’s finances, and the surgeon’s technical expertise.\nIncomplete fractures in young, healthy dogs can be treated with external splints or casts. Other injuries are treated with external devices (fixators), bone plates, screws, orthopedic wires, or pins. Bone grafts are frequently used to help healing. Antibiotics are given to keep open fractures from becoming infected. Appropriate pain-relieving medication is used to reduce discomfort. Physical therapy or rehabilitation after the surgery is critical to the healing process.\nThe outlook for recovery is usually good, depending on the injury and the success of the surgery. Follow-up care includes x-rays and veterinary checkups to assess how the fracture is healing. Removal of internal implants like bone plates or screws is not necessary unless complications such as stress protection, infection, and soft-tissue irritation develop."

      "content": "In sarcocystosis, the muscles and other soft tissues are invaded by single-celled organisms, called protozoans, of the genus Sarcocystis. Although their final hosts are predators such as dogs and cats, these organisms form cysts in various intermediate hosts, including cattle, pigs, people, horses, sheep, goats, birds, camels, wildlife, rodents, and reptiles. Some cysts are visible to the naked eye, but others are too small to see. Their size depends on the species of the host and the species of Sarcocystis. A dog can develop sarcocystosis after eating undercooked beef or pork containing sporocysts or after eating food infected with sporocysts from another animal’s feces. Infected dogs often have no signs, although a mild diarrhea may be seen.\nAs noted above, people may serve as intermediate hosts and can develop inflammation and soreness of muscles and blood vessels. This condition is rare, and the source of human infection has never been determined. Signs present after eating infected, uncooked meat include nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea lasting up to 48 hours. The extent of human illness caused by infected meat has not been documented.\nBecause most adult cattle and sheep and many pigs harbor cysts in their muscles, dogs should not be allowed to eat raw meat, edible organs (such as heart, liver, tongue, and brains), or dead animals. Cattle and other livestock can become infected from eating the feces of affected dogs. Supplies of grain and feed should be kept covered. Dogs should not be allowed in buildings used to store feed or house animals. There are no available vaccines. Experiments have shown that infected pork can be made safe for consumption by cooking at 158°F (70°C) for 15 minutes or by freezing at 25°F (-4°C) for 2 days or -4°F (-20°C) for 1 day.",

These create complex circuits through which animals experience and respond to sensations.\nA familiar type of nervous system circuit is a reflex. Reflexes are simple networks found in the nervous system of all animals. For example, when the eyelid is touched, it closes; when the toe is pinched, the foot pulls away “automatically.”\nMany different types of diseases can affect the nervous system, including birth defects, inherited disorders, infections, inflammatory conditions, poisoning, metabolic disorders, nutritional disorders, injuries, degenerative diseases, cancer, or unknown causes.

The brain is divided into 3 main sections—the brain stem, which controls many basic life functions, the cerebrum, which is the center of conscious decision-making, and the cerebellum, which is involved in movement and motor control. The spinal cord of dogs is divided into regions that correspond to the vertebral bodies (the bones that make up the spine) in the following order from neck to tail: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal segments. Specialized tissues called the meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.\nThe peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves that are found throughout the rest of the body.",
      "Neurons": {
        "title": "Neurons",
        "content": "Both the central and peripheral nervous systems contain billions of cells known as neurons. Neurons connect with each other to form neurological circuits. Information travels along these circuits via electrical signals.\nAll neurons have a center portion called a cell body and 2 extensions called dendrites and axons. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons and transmit electrical charges to the cell body. Axons transmit the electrical charges away from the cell body. When the current reaches the end of the axon, the axon releases chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neuro-transmitters pass the signal to the dendrites of other neurons, or to muscles or glands.\nNeurons in the peripheral nervous system combine to form pairs of spinal nerves and pairs of cranial nerves. The spinal nerves arise from the spinal cord and extend axons outward into the front and hind legs and to the bladder, anus, and tail. These nerves subdivide into smaller nerves that cover the entire surface and interior of the body. The cranial nerves include sensory and motor neurons that connect the head and face to the brain.",

Sensory information includes sensations of pain, position, touch, temperature, taste, hearing, balance, vision, and smell.\nMotor neurons carry responses to the sensory information from the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. Inside the spinal cord, the axons of motor neurons form bundles known as tracts, which transmit this information to motor peripheral nerves going to muscles in the limbs. Motor neurons are important for voluntary movements and muscle control.\nA specialized set of neurons controls and regulates basic, unconscious bodily functions that support life, such as the pumping of the heart and digestion. These neurons make up what is called the autonomic nervous system, which sends axons from the brain stem and spinal cord to various areas of the body such as the heart muscle, the digestive system, and the pupils of the eyes."

      "title": "Nervous System Disorders and Effects of Injuries in Dogs",
      "content": "A change in an animal’s ability to sense its environment can be caused by disease in either the central nervous system or the peripheral nervous system. The primary signs of nervous system disorders include behavioral changes, seizures, tremors, pain, numbness, lack of coordination, and weakness or paralysis of one or more legs. The effects of an injury on sensory and motor functions depend on its location and severity.\nA spinal cord injury can cause loss of feeling and paralysis below the level of the injury. Mild spinal cord injuries can result in clumsy movement and mild weakness of the limbs. Moderate spinal cord injuries can cause a greater weakness of the limbs. In severe spinal cord injuries, a complete loss of movement (paralysis) and feeling can occur. However, not all spinal cord injuries cause paralysis. For example, injury to the spinal cord in the lower back can result not in limb paralysis but in loss of bladder control.\nBrain injuries result in different effects, again depending on which part of the brain is affected. Injuries to the brain stem can cause a loss of balance, weakness of the limbs, hyperactive reflexes, stupor, or coma. Injuries to the cerebellum can result in a lack of coordination of the head and legs, tremors, and a loss of balance. Injuries to the cerebrum can cause complete or partial blindness, loss of the sense of smell, seizures, coma, stupor, pacing or circling behavior, and inability to recognize an owner.\nSome injuries to the nervous system can cause damage that is not evident until 24 to 48 hours after the injury occurs. Longterm damage is usually caused by swelling or internal bleeding of the vessels in the brain. Strokes caused by clogged arteries or high blood pressure are rare in pets.",

Some genetic diseases cause the neurons to degenerate slowly and irreversibly in the first year of life. In other inherited diseases, such as epilepsy, the animal may not show any signs for 2 to 3 years.\nInfections of the nervous system are caused by specific viruses or microorganisms. Other inflammations, such as certain types of meningitis, can be caused by the body’s own overactive immune system. These are known as autoimmune disorders. Various chemicals can cause a toxic reaction in the nervous system. These include certain pesticides and herbicides, rat poisons, antifreeze, chocolate, and sedatives. High doses of certain types of medication can also be toxic to the nervous system. Botulism, tetanus, and tick bites, as well as coral and tiger snake venom, can also affect the nervous system and cause paralysis.\nSome metabolic disorders affect the function of the nervous system, including low blood sugar, shortness or loss of breath, liver disease, and kidney failure. Thyroid and adrenal gland abnormalities and electrolyte imbalances can also cause neurologic signs. A lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the diet can cause a loss of motor control, stupor, seizures, and coma in dogs. Inadequate amounts of B6 can cause seizures."

Tumors may grow from cells within or associated with the nervous system, they can form in surrounding tissues, or they can spread to the nervous system from another tumor in the body.\nBrain tumors are occasionally found in young animals, but most are found in mature and older animals. In dogs, the brain is the more common site of primary tumors of the nervous system than the spinal cord ( see Tumors) or peripheral nerves ( see Tumors). Adult dogs of several brachycephalic breeds—Boxers, English Bulldogs, and Boston Terriers—are often reported as having the highest incidence of brain tumors among domestic animals. (Brachycephalic dog breeds are those that have characteristically flattened faces and short noses.) Golden retrievers may be more likely to have brain tumors.\nA variety of tests are used to confirm the presence of a brain tumor. Plain x-rays, myelography, scintigraphy, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance imaging are all used to diagnose nervous system tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may also be useful.\nThe outlook for animals with nervous system tumors is generally guarded to poor, and depends on the location, extent of tissue damage, access by surgery, and rate of tumor growth. Recent improvements in treatment have centered on surgical removal, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy ( See also heading on page Cancer Treatment)."

Testing the reflexes of these nerves can help identify the location of the damage.\nAn evaluation of the head tests mental activity, head posture and coordination, and cranial nerves. Signs identified during this evaluation indicate an injury or disease of the brain. Signs of damage to the cerebrum and diencephalon (higher brain centers) can include mental deterioration, constant pacing, seizures, depression or coma, or a head turn or circling in one direction.

Blood tests can also identify other conditions, including lead poisoning, certain infections, and myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disease in which the connections between nerve and muscle are blocked and weakness results. Muscle, nerve, or (rarely) brain biopsies may be necessary to diagnose certain disorders.\nAnalysis of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) is often useful for diagnosing a central nervous system disorder. Cerebrospinal fluid is collected from the base of the skull or from the lower back in a procedure called a spinal tap. An unusually high amount of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid may indicate encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), meningitis (inflammation of the covering of the brain), cancer, or a compressive injury of the spinal cord. Increased numbers of white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate an inflammation or infection. Other disorders that can be identified by cerebrospinal fluid analysis include bacterial or fungal infections, internal bleeding, brain abscesses, and some types of tumors. Cerebrospinal fluid can also be tested for the presence of canine distemper virus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and some other infectious diseases.\nSeveral different types of radiographic tests can be used to detect disorders of the nervous system. Plain x-rays of the skull and spine can detect fractures, infections, or bone cancer. However, in most infections or cancers of the brain and spinal cord, plain x‑rays appear normal. In a procedure known as myelography, a special dye that is visible on x‑rays is injected into the cerebrospinal canal. This dye can highlight specific types of spinal problems, such as herniated (“slipped”) discs and spinal cord tumors. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can also help evaluate changes in bone structure, internal bleeding, abscesses, inflammation, and certain nervous system cancers.\nOther tests may be used in some cases. An electroencephalogram records electrical activity in the brain. Results are abnormal in meningitis or encephalitis, head injuries, brain tumors, and a condition called hydrocephalus (water on the brain). An electroencephalogram can sometimes help determine the cause and severity of a seizure. An electromyogram records electrical activity in muscles to evaluate nerve and muscle function. In this test, a nerve is stimulated electrically, and the speed of conduction along the neurons is calculated. This technique can detect nerve injury and myasthenia gravis. A brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) records electrical activity in the pathway from the sound receptors in the ear to the brain stem and cerebrum. In cases of deafness caused by nerve damage, the BAER generates no response. Brain stem disorders may also change the BAER. Spinal cord evoked potentials are a test of spinal cord function. They are done by stimulating a peripheral nerve and then measuring electrical activity in the spinal cord."

This condition is not uncommon in puppies, especially in toy and brachycephalic breeds, such as Pugs, Bulldogs, and Bull Mastiffs. Hydrocephalus usually results in signs similar to those of a cerebral injury, and may worsen over time. However, some animals may not show any obvious signs. Blindness or impaired vision can also develop. Ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can confirm the diagnosis. This condition may be treated with omeprazole or corticosteroids, but surgery may be necessary in severe cases.\nIdiopathic epilepsy refers to epileptic seizures of unknown cause. It may be inherited in certain breeds, including Beagles, Keeshonden, Irish Setters, Belgian Tervurens, Siberian Huskies, Springer Spaniels, Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds. A diagnosis of idiopathic epilepsy depends on eliminating other causes of seizures, particularly structural brain abnormalities (such as hydrocephalus), encephalitis, or metabolic disorders, such as hepatic encephalopathy.\nHepatic encephalopathy is usually caused by a birth defect that leads to blood vessel abnormalities within the liver, or in rare cases it may result from an enzyme deficiency in the liver. Breeds often affected include Miniature Schnauzers, Yorkshire Terriers, Cairn Terriers, Australian Cattle Dogs, Old English Sheepdogs, and Maltese Terriers. Nervous system signs are usually evident before the pup is 6 months old. Signs include “staring into space,” inappropriate barking or whining, aggression, and agitation. In advanced disease, depression, blindness, sudden jerking motions, stupor, coma, or seizures can be seen. Hepatic encephalopathy is diagnosed by using radiographic imaging techniques, such as computed tomography or ultrasonography. Blood tests may aid in diagnosis.\nPuppy hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is seen in toy breeds in the first 6 months of life. It seems to relate to a relative immaturity of the liver.

Some puppies can regain the ability to walk but remain weak.\nAlaskan Malamute polyneuropathy affects 10- to 18-month-old Alaskan Malamutes. These dogs typically have difficulty exercising, weakness in the rear legs that spreads to the front legs, muscle wasting, and, sometimes, paralysis of the vocal cords (laryngeal paralysis). There is no effective treatment. Signs do not worsen in some dogs, but most affected dogs have to be euthanized due to worsening of their disability.\nCongenital laryngeal paralysis is vocal cord paralysis that occurs in Siberian Huskies, Rottweilers, Bull Terriers, and Bouvier des Flandres puppies less than a year old. Affected dogs have difficulty breathing and exercising. Veterinarians diagnose the condition by looking at the vocal folds while the dog is under sedation. Laryngeal paralysis can also occur with widespread peripheral nerve dysfunction in several breeds, including Dalmatians, Rottweilers, and Pyrenean Mountain Dogs (Great Pyrenees). Prognosis is guarded to poor.\nSensory neuropathy of longhaired Dachshunds causes incoordination, an impaired sense of paw position, and decreased sensation in 8- to 12-week-old longhaired Dachshund puppies. They can also have impaired digestive and urinary functions. There is no treatment, but these dogs can have a relatively good quality of life as long as they do not chew excessively on their bodies.\nSensory neuropathy of Border Collies causes incoordination, an impaired sense of paw position, and decreased sensation in 5- to 7-month-old Border Collies. There is no treatment, and unfortunately, the disease progresses to a point that most affected dogs have to be euthanized.\nSensory neuropathy of Pointers is seen in English Pointers in the USA and Shorthaired Pointers in Europe. When these puppies are less than 6 months old, they begin to chew excessively on their toes. Their ability to feel pain is reduced in the front legs and absent in the rear legs. There is no treatment, and the outlook is poor.\nSigns of inherited polyneuropathy of Leonberger dogs begin when they are 1–9 years of age. The signs include weakness, difficulty exercising and breathing, and a change in the sound of the bark.\nMusladin-Lueke syndrome is a condition that appears in Beagles shortly after birth. Muscle contracture and scarring (fibrosis) cause these puppies to look like they are walking on their \"tip-toes.\" Affected dogs can have thickened ear cartilage and wide-set eyes. Seizures are also possible. There is no treatment, but the signs are usually not progressive.\nCongenital myasthenia gravis is noticed in Parson Russell Terriers, Smooth-haired Fox Terriers, and Springer Spaniels when they are 5–10 weeks old. It has also been seen in 12- to 16-week-old Gammel Dansk Hønsehund dogs. These puppies are weak after playing and may regurgitate due to an enlarged esophagus. The outlook is uncertain, and puppies that are born with myasthenia gravis tend to do worse than older dogs that develop it.\nScotty cramp causes increased muscle tone in Scottish Terrier puppies that worsens with excitement, exercise, and poor health. The puppies have an exaggerated gait and arched spine severe enough to cause them to somersault when they run. Muscle relaxants can relieve these signs.\nCongenital myoclonus of Labrador Retrievers (familial reflex myoclonus) causes muscle spasms and increased muscle tone in young Labs. These puppies have such rigid muscles that they may be unable to walk. The outlook is very poor.\nMyotonia congenita is severe stiffness upon rising in Chow Chows, Staffordshire Terriers, Great Danes, and Miniature Schnauzers. The signs are similar to those seen in \"fainting\" goats that freeze and fall over when startled. The outlook is uncertain, but medications can significantly improve signs.\nLabrador Retriever myopathy causes a stiff gait and muscle wasting in puppies as young as 3 months of age. An affected dog may not even be able to keep its head up. Exercise, stress, and cold temperatures worsen signs. Fortunately, the signs do not worsen after 6–8 months of age, and these dogs can be good pets.\nDermatomyositis of Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs occurs in puppies just a few months old. It affects Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, Beauceron Shepherds, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Australian Cattle Dogs, Lakeland Terriers, Chow Chows, German Shepherds, and Kuvasz dogs. It causes withering of the jaw muscles used for chewing and the muscles in the lower legs. This can lead to weakness, difficulty opening the mouth, and regurgitation due to an enlarged esophagus. Affected dogs also have skin inflammation on the face and legs. The signs, which are usually not severe, may come and go.\nGlycogen storage diseases cause muscle weakness and difficulty exercising in young German Shepherds, Akitas, Lapland dogs, and English Springer Spaniels.\nMitochondrial myopathy has been seen in Clumber and Sussex Spaniels and in Old English Sheepdogs. Affected dogs have difficulty exercising and can collapse. The condition is diagnosed by examining tissue samples taken by biopsy.\nCentral core myopathy can cause weakness, muscle loss, trouble exercising, and collapse in young Great Danes. It has been reported in the United Kingdom. Signs begin at approximately 6 months of age. The outlook is poor.\nCongenital megaesophagus describes an enlarged esophagus seen at birth. It is inherited in Wirehaired Fox Terriers and Miniature Schnauzers and might be inherited in German Shepherds, Great Danes, Irish Setters, Newfoundlands, Chinese Shar-Pei, and Greyhounds. Food gets trapped in the enlarged esophagus and is then regurgitated. These dogs can inhale this food, leading to pneumonia. The outlook is uncertain."

        "content": "Acquired laryngeal paralysis is common in middle-aged and older dogs, especially in large breeds, such as Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and Saint Bernards. In most cases, the cause is unknown, and the disorder is a component of more widespread degeneration of peripheral nerves known as canine chronic axonal degeneration (see below). It can also be caused by an injury or tumor affecting the neck or by thyroid disorders. The condition occurs when nerve degeneration leads to paralysis of one or more cartilages in the larynx (\"voice box\"). The paralyzed cartilage(s) partially block the airway, causing a voice change, noisy breathing, or a dry cough. In severe cases, the dog may have difficulty breathing, be unwilling or unable to exercise, and the tongue and gums may turn bluish. Some dogs have more general signs of a neurologic disorder, such as weakness and reduced sense of position. Veterinarians diagnose the condition by examining the dog's larynx while the dog is under light anesthesia. Although surgery cannot completely resolve the signs, it can usually relieve the breathing difficulties.\nCanine chronic axonal degeneration also affects middle-aged and older dogs. Degeneration of the axons in many peripheral nerves throughout the body results in difficulty walking, incoordination, weakness in all limbs, and muscle wasting. Affected dogs may have laryngeal paralysis as one of the first signs of the disorder. Paralysis of the muscles in the face or difficulty swallowing are also seen. Veterinarians diagnose the condition based on the signs of the disease, electronic tests of nerve speed, and nerve and muscle biopsies. Other diseases with similar signs (such as hypothyroidism) must also be ruled out. There is no specific treatment, and the neurologic signs slowly worsen.\nDancing Doberman disease is a neuromuscular disorder that affects Doberman Pinschers older than 6 months. Initially, dogs repeatedly flex the hip and extend one hind leg while standing. Within several months, most dogs alternately flex and extend both hind legs in a dance-like motion. They often prefer to sit rather than stand. The condition slowly progresses to mild partial paralysis. The front legs are not affected. The cause is unknown. There is no treatment, and signs do not improve. However, this disease usually does not result in severe disability and does not appear to be painful.\nDistal denervating disease is a condition that affects multiple peripheral nerves. It is common among dogs in the UK, but has not been reported elsewhere. The cause is unknown. Any age and breed of dog may be affected. The onset of signs varies from a few days to several weeks. There is progressive weakness of all 4 legs, reduced reflexes, and muscle degeneration. Sensory loss is not apparent. Electrodiagnostic testing typically shows loss of nerve control of limb muscles. Peripheral nerve biopsies are usually normal, but examination of nerves within a muscle may be diagnostic. Treatment is supportive, and the prognosis is excellent, with recovery in 4–6 weeks. Relapse has not been reported.\nDistal polyneuropathy of Rottweilers is characterized by weakness on one side that slowly progresses to weakness of all 4 legs, reduced reflexes, and muscle loss. Signs can get progressively worse or can wax and wane. Male and female Rottweilers 1–4 years old have been affected. The cause is unknown. Electrodiagnostic testing shows loss of nerve function in muscles toward the end of the limbs and decreased nerve conduction speed. Prognosis is poor, although some dogs may temporarily improve with corticosteroid treatment.\nIdiopathic facial paralysis is a common disorder that results in weakness or paralysis of the facial muscles in dogs and cats. Cocker Spaniels, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Boxers, English Setters, and domestic longhaired cats are at increased risk. There is a sudden onset of an inability to blink one or both eyes, drooping ears, drooping upper lip, and drooling from the corner of the mouth. Facial sensation (controlled by the trigeminal nerve) remains normal. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and exclusion of other causes of facial paralysis, including ear disease, trauma, and brain stem lesions. The cause is unknown, and there is no specific treatment. Artificial tears often help prevent corneal damage. Partial improvement may occur in a few weeks, but the loss of function often persists."

It is most common in adult German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, and Labrador Retrievers. Common signs are stiffness (brought on by exercise), tremors, and weakness that improve with rest. Weakness of the face and throat muscles is common, and often there is difficulty swallowing or regurgitation of food after eating. Pneumonia is a frequent complication. Diagnosis requires a blood test. Medications are available for long-term treatment. The outlook for recovery is generally good, but less so for animals that suffer complications. An uncommon form of the disease, called fulminant myasthenia, causes sudden paralysis that quickly leads to respiratory paralysis and death.\nAcute idiopathic polyradiculoneuritis causes inflammation of peripheral nerves. Signs often develop 7 to 14 days after a raccoon bite or scratch (leading to the name of Coonhound paralysis); however, not all affected animals have been exposed to raccoons. A similar syndrome can develop in dogs within 1 to 2 weeks of a vaccination. Typically, the hind legs become weak and within 24 to 48 hours the signs progress to partial or full paralysis in all legs and, in some cases, weakness in the face and throat. Occasionally, the front legs are affected first. Typically, muscle wasting is severe within 2 weeks. The dog does not lose its pain perception or bladder and bowel function. There is no effective treatment other than nursing care. Most affected animals begin to improve within 3 weeks, with complete recovery by 2 to 6 months. However, animals with severe signs may not recover completely, and death can occur from respiratory paralysis. Relapses are also seen, especially in hunting dogs that frequently encounter raccoons.\nChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy causes gradual weakness of all limbs, with decreased reflexes. The cranial nerves are sometimes also affected. It is fairly common in dogs, but the cause is unknown. Signs can improve with the use of corticosteroids but sometimes return once medications are stopped.\nTrigeminal neuritis results in inflammation of and damage to the trigeminal nerve, causing a sudden onset of jaw paralysis. Affected animals cannot close the mouth and have difficulty eating and drinking. Partial paralysis and a loss of sensation in the rest of the face are also possible. The cause is unknown. Signs usually resolve within 3 to 4 weeks. Fluid and nutritional support may be necessary."

A large tumor may appear as a visible lump. Partial paralysis and muscle wasting eventually develop in the affected leg. If the tumor spreads, it may eventually put pressure against the spinal cord, causing neurologic signs in other legs. Nerve sheath tumors can also form in the cranial nerves, most frequently in the trigeminal nerve. This results in muscle wasting and pain on one side of the jaw. Eventually, the brain stem can become compressed, leading to death. Surgery can be very beneficial at an early stage, but recurrence is common.\nIn paraneoplastic neuropathy, a cancer outside the nervous system causes damage to nerves. It is most common in dogs with insulinoma but has been associated with a variety of other tumors. This condition is not well understood, but it may be caused by an immune system response to a tumor that indirectly harms the nervous system. Signs typically involve partial paralysis in either 2 or 4 legs that progressively worsens over several weeks. Diagnosis requires identification of the underlying tumor. Signs may improve with successful treatment of the tumor."

        "content": "Organophosphate poisoning can result from exposure to pesticides, herbicides, or other industrial chemicals. The signs depend on the severity of exposure. The acute form prevents the body’s acetylcholinesterase from working properly. Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that is essential for the proper function of connections between neurons, and between nerve and muscle. Signs of severe poisoning can include vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, shortness of breath, muscle tremors and twitching, seizures, or coma.\nThe intermediate form can cause generalized muscle weakness. Affected animals may not show obvious signs at first, but partial paralysis of the legs and weakness of the neck can develop several days after exposure. The pupils may be dilated. Treatment of acute or intermediate toxicity includes the drug atropine, which blocks the effects of the organophosphate. Other medications are used to relieve the tremors and muscle weakness. Treatment for several weeks may be necessary.\nIn the delayed form of toxicity, the nerves slowly degenerate. This form is unrelated to the effects on acetylcholinesterase. Signs develop several weeks after exposure and typically involve weakness and loss of motor control in the hind legs. There is no specific treatment.\nTick paralysis is caused by the bite of several species of ticks that results in rapidly progressing paralysis. In Australia, the tick Ixodes holocyclus causes an especially severe form of tick paralysis. Other tick species can induce paralysis on other continents, including North America. Signs begin with partial paralysis in the hind legs that worsens within 24 to 72 hours to total paralysis in all 4 legs. Sensory perception and consciousness remain normal. Difficulty swallowing, facial paralysis, jaw muscle weakness, and respiratory paralysis may develop in severe cases. Treatment consists of removing the tick and applying medication to kill any hidden ticks. For all except Ixodes holocyclus cases in Australia, recovery usually occurs in 1 to 2 days. A serum is available for treatment of Ixodes holocyclus paralysis, but death from respiratory paralysis can occur despite treatment."

        "title": "Injury and Trauma",
        "content": "Brachial plexus avulsion occurs in dogs due to injury to the spinal nerve roots in the neck and shoulder area that extend nerves into the front legs. In a severe injury, the nerve roots may stretch or tear from their attachment to the spinal cord. Signs vary depending on the severity. If the nerves are completely torn, paralysis of the leg and a loss of sensation and reflexes below the elbow result. The animal puts little or no weight on the leg and drags the paw on the ground. The leg may need to be amputated because of damage from dragging or self-mutilation. Recovery is possible in mild cases in which the nerve roots are bruised but not completely torn.\nPeripheral nerve injuries are common in traumatic injuries. The sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back to the hind legs, may be injured by hip fractures or during surgery to correct a broken leg. Irritants injected in or near the nerve can also cause nerve damage. The leg may be partially paralyzed, or the animal may not be able to flex the knee. The paw and digits cannot flex or extend. There may be loss of sensation below the knee. Injury to the branches of the sciatic nerve in the lower leg, such as the tibial nerve or the peroneal nerve, can result in an inability to extend the paw or flex the digits and reduced sensation over the surface of the foot.\nFor function to return after nerve connections are lost, the nerve must regenerate from the point of injury all the way to where it ends in the muscle. Nerve tissue regenerates or heals very slowly. Recovery is unlikely if the severed ends of the nerve are widely separated or if scar tissue interferes with healing. Anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to treat traumatic nerve injuries, although there is little evidence of any benefit. Surgery should be performed promptly in cases in which the nerve has been cut. In cases of injury from a fall or a blunt object, surgical exploration and removal of scar tissue may help. Longterm care consists of physical therapy to minimize muscle wasting and to keep the joints moving. Bandages or splints may be necessary to help protect a damaged limb."

Signs include sudden, painful hind limb weakness or paralysis with a loss of several reflexes. Treament includes pain medications, supportive care, and management of the underlying disease that caused the blockage. Medications that prevent clotting may also be used. Improvement can be seen within 2–3 weeks, but it can take up to 6 months for an animal to recover completely. Unfortunately, many animals do not survive the first episode, and those that do have an uncertain longterm outcome because of serious underlying conditions and increased risk for future blood clots."

It is most common in large breeds of dogs, especially German Shepherds. The cause is unknown. Signs typically begin at 3 to 7 years of age and may include difficulty using the hind legs, tail weakness, and incontinence. Dogs often experience pain when the lower back is touched or moved. Other signs include a loss of paw position sense, muscle wasting, or weakened reflexes in the hind legs. X-rays may show signs of degeneration, but diagnosis requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Dogs in which mild pain is the only sign may improve with 4 to 6 weeks of rest and pain medications. Specific treatment requires surgery. The outlook for recovery after surgery is good, although urinary incontinence may continue.\nAbnormal development of the vertebrae in the neck squeezes the spinal cord in dogs with cervical spondylomyelopathy (also called wobbler syndrome and cervical malformation-malarticulation), There are two forms of the disease: disc-associated wobbler syndrome (DAWS) and bony-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy. DAWS affects middle-aged (approximately 7 years old), large-breed dogs, especially Doberman Pinschers. In this condition, one or more discs between the neck vertebrae extend into the spinal canal and squeeze the spinal cord. Bony-associated compression affects young (usually 4 years or younger), giant-breed dogs, such as Great Danes, Mastiffs, and Rottweilers. In this condition, abnormal bone growth occurs in the vertebrae of the neck and squeezes the spinal cord. For both forms of the disease, signs occur slowly or suddenly and include incoordination and an abnormal stride when walking on all four limbs. Weakness or paralysis in all legs as well as neck pain may also be present. X-rays can help rule out other conditions, but diagnosis requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Dogs with mild signs may improve with rest and medication, but surgery is often necessary. Most dogs (~80%) do well with surgery.\nDegeneration of motor neurons is an inherited disease seen now and then in Brittany Spaniels, Pointers, German Shepherds, Doberman Pinschers, and Rottweillers. It is also seen in cats, cattle, pigs, and goats. Also called spinal muscular atrophy, this disease is characterized by progressive weakness, shaking, muscle loss, and weak reflexes. It usually appears by 2 years of age. Electronic muscle testing and biopsy help document the nerve changes, but definitive diagnosis is based on examination of tissues with a microscope.\nDegenerative myelopathy of dogs (also called chronic degenerative radiculomyelopathy) is an inherited disease that occurs in German Shepherds, Pembroke Welsh Corgis, Boxers, Rhodesian Ridgebacks, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and other breeds. Affected dogs exhibit degeneration of nerve fibers (axons) and the sheath that surrounds them (myelin). Dogs with the condition are usually older than 8 years of age and slowly start to display nonpainful incoordination and weakness of the hind limbs. It can be confused with orthopedic disorders (such as arthritis), but dogs with degenerative myelopathy have difficulty sensing and placing their feet normally whereas arthritic dogs do not. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment for the disease, and most affected dogs are euthanized within 1–3 years.\nDiffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by bony growths at the sites where a ligament, tendon, or joint capsule inserts into bone. It is also known as Forestier disease in human patients. Approximately 4% of dogs >1 yr old are affected, and the number affected increases with age. As with spondylosis deformans, Boxers are at increased risk, with ~40% showing signs of the disease. The chest and lower back are the areas most commonly affected. It is unclear how often DISH causes clinical signs, and in many cases there are changes seen on x-rays do not lead to clinical problems. However, spinal pain and stiffness is possible, and in those cases analgesics can be given as needed.\nIntervertebral disc disease is a degenerative disease of the spinal column that results in compression of the spinal cord and/or spinal nerves. It is a common cause of spinal cord disorders in dogs, especially of small breeds, particularly the Dachshund, Beagle, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, and Pekingese. In these breeds, spinal discs can begin degenerating in the first few months of life. A herniated or “slipped” disc causing severe signs can occur suddenly, as early as 1 to 2 years of age. In contrast, disc degeneration in large breeds of dogs typically occurs after the age of 5 years, and signs slowly continue to worsen. Herniated discs are most common in the neck and the middle of the back. A herniated disc in the neck leads to neck pain, stiffness, and muscle spasms. There may be muscle weakness or other signs, ranging from mild partial paralysis in the legs to total paralysis of all legs. A herniated disc in the middle of the back leads to back pain, and possibly curvature in the spine and a reluctance to move. Neurologic signs range from a loss of motor control in the hind legs to paralysis and incontinence. In paralyzed animals, it is important to determine whether pain sensation is present by pinching the toe or tail and watching whether the dog makes a behavioral response, such as a bark or turn of the head.\nDiagnosis of herniated discs requires x‑rays, myelography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dogs with minimal to moderate signs that can still feel pain often recover with a few weeks of rest. Anti-inflammatory or pain medication can be used, but generally only if the dog can be cage-rested. If the dog increases its activity, the disc(s) may extrude further and worsen the spinal cord compression. Unfortunately, signs recur in 30% to 40% of cases. In dogs with severe neurologic signs, surgery must be performed promptly to relieve the pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is also needed if drug therapy is unsuccessful and signs return. The outlook for recovery after surgery is good if the dog can still feel pain. If surgery is delayed for more than 24 hours after pain perception is lost, the chances of recovery decrease.\nSpondylosis deformans is characterized by the production of bony growths along the underside of the spinal vertebrae. It develops as dogs age, and 25%–70% of 9-year-old dogs are affected. It is especially common in Boxers. It does not typically cause signs, but dogs may experience back pain in rare cases."

Animals with neurologic signs can display twitching, chewing of the jaw, and seizures, and they can sometimes lose motor control or develop paralysis. Definitive diagnosis is difficult without a necropsy. There is no specific treatment, and the outlook for recovery is poor for dogs with severe signs. Vaccination is usually successful in preventing distemper.\nRabies is caused by a viral infection that spreads to the central nervous system from the peripheral nerves. Rabies is common throughout the world except in Japan and some other islands, including New Zealand, Iceland, and Hawaii. Initial signs are extremely variable, and rabies should be considered a possibility in any unvaccinated animal with severe neurologic dysfunction. Signs that the infection has reached the spinal cord include a loss of motor control and progressive paralysis, usually with a loss of reflexes.

Adult dogs do not typically show signs of the disease, but puppies can have a fever, diarrhea, trouble breathing, and seizures, and some may die. A blood test or tissue sample can be used to diagnose the infection. Various drugs are recommended for treatment."

Signs of spinal cord inflammation strike suddenly and severely, often affecting one side of the body more than the other, and may progressively worsen over time. This condition is difficult to diagnose except by examination of tissues after death. Drug treatment can be beneficial, but a full recovery is uncertain."

The cause is unknown, but it may be a viral infection. There are 2 different forms of the disease that have different effects within the body, but the signs are similar, and often include neck pain and partial paralysis in all 4 legs. Adult dogs of any breed can be affected, but female small-breed dogs, especially Poodles, are at highest risk. Signs can occur suddenly or slowly worsen over several months. Diagnosis includes cerebrospinal fluid analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), and ruling out other diseases. Dogs often improve temporarily with drug treatment, but the longterm outlook is uncertain."

A specific tumor called a nephroblastoma can affect young dogs (from 5 to 36 months of age), with German Shepherds affected most commonly. This tumor is frequently in the middle or lower back, causing progressively worsening partial paralysis in the hind legs. Imaging (including x-rays, myelography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and surgical biopsy are used to identify and confirm a diagnosis of spinal cancer. Surgery is possible in some cases."

        "title": "Injury and Trauma",
        "content": "Spinal cord injuries usually occur as a result of a spinal fracture or dislocation. Common causes in dogs include automobile accidents, bite wounds, and gunshot wounds. The injury not only causes initial damage to the spinal cord, but also causes secondary damage from swelling, bleeding, destruction of the nerve sheath, and tissue decay. Signs of spinal trauma typically have a sudden and severe onset, and may progressively worsen. Severe spinal cord injury to the middle or lower back may cause a rigid paralysis, or a limp paralysis that spreads to the entire body over several days and leads to death from respiratory paralysis. Fractured or dislocated vertebrae can often be seen on x-rays, but computed tomography (CT) may be necessary to see some fractures. Drug treatment can be helpful, especially if started within the first few hours of injury. Animals with mild neurologic signs from injury often recover after 4 to 6 weeks of cage rest and pain medications. Surgery is necessary for some types of injuries that cause severe neurologic signs. In dogs that have lost the ability to feel pain at locations below the spinal injury, the outlook for recovery is poor."

In addition to the signs of severe exposure, delayed paralysis can develop 1 to 4 weeks after exposure. Partial paralysis of the hind legs worsens progressively, and occasionally all 4 legs become paralyzed. A veterinarian will need a history of the dog’s possible chemical exposure to make the correct diagnosis. The outlook for recovery is poor for animals with severe signs.\nTetanus is caused by toxins produced by Clostridium tetani bacteria that usually enter the body at the site of a wound. Dogs are fairly resistant to tetanus, but cases do sometimes occur. Signs usually develop within 5 to 10 days of infection and include muscle stiffness and rigid leg extension, inability to swallow, protruding eyelids, and locking of the jaw and facial muscles. In severe cases, the animal may be unable to stand as a result of muscle spasms. Treatment consists of wound care, antibiotics to kill any remaining organisms, and tetanus antitoxin. In mild cases, a dog may recover completely with early treatment. In severe cases, death may occur due to respiratory paralysis."

It is usually seen in adult dogs, especially large and giant breeds, Miniature Schnauzers and Shetland Sheepdogs. It typically begins after jumping or running and causes a sudden, nonpainful change in the dog's gait. Magnetic resonance imaging is used to make the diagnosis. Mildly affected dogs usually improve within 1–2 weeks, but the outlook is poor for severely affected dogs or those that do not show signs of improvement."

Other components of the nervous system, including central, peripheral, skeletal, and digestive nerves, are also affected. Cases have been reported from both Europe and the United States, where canine dysautonomia has been seen primarily in the Midwest. Signs often include a loss of the pupillary light reflexes, with otherwise normal vision. The eyelid may droop or protrude abnormally, and the position of the eyeball may be abnormal. The dog may experience painful or difficult urination and lose anal sphincter control. Secondary signs such as pneumonia and lethargic behavior may develop. Weight loss may be dramatic. There is no treatment and the condition is ultimately fatal."

      "title": "Facial Paralysis in Dogs",
      "content": "Facial paralysis in dogs may result from injuries caused by rough handling or other trauma, such as automobile accidents, inner ear infections, hypothyroidism, tumors, and unknown causes. Paralysis on one side of the face is common when the facial nerve is damaged. Facial paralysis on both sides of the face can be more difficult to recognize, but affected animals often drool and have a dull facial expression. In total facial paralysis, the animal cannot move its eyelids, ears, lips, or nostrils. In partial paralysis, the muscles of facial expression move less than normal.\nThe signs of facial paralysis vary with the location and severity of the injury. One or both sides of the face can be affected. Usually, the signs include loss of motor function, including the inability to blink, a drooping ear, a drooping upper lip, and drooling from the corner of the mouth. When the animal eats or drinks, food and water may fall out of the mouth. The nose may seem to turn away from the side of the injury because muscle tone on the injured side is reduced. Decreased tear production can cause one or both eyes to be dry.\nInfection of the inner ear is a common cause of facial paralysis, especially in dogs with chronic skin conditions. This can be diagnosed with ear examination, x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scans, and bacterial cultures. The prognosis for recovery can be good if the diagnosis is made early and the animal receives appropriate antibiotic treatment. However, the facial nerve paralysis can be permanent, and longterm administration of eye drops may be necessary.\nA low-functioning thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can also cause facial nerve paralysis. In such cases, thyroid replacement therapy can sometimes resolve facial paralysis completely.\nIdiopathic facial paralysis (like Bell’s palsy in humans) is diagnosed in the absence of infection, reduced thyroid function, injury, or trauma. There is no treatment, and regular administration of lubricating eye drops may be necessary. One or both sides of the face can be affected, and the condition can be either temporary or permanent. It can occur on one side, disappear, and then occur on the other side at a later time. Permanent paralysis may give the face an unusual appearance but does not usually affect the quality of life in dogs.\nTumors that affect the facial nerve or middle ear can cause facial paralysis. Examining the middle ear with an otoscope (an instrument that allows a veterinarian to see into the ear), analyzing tissue samples, and using advanced imaging (MRI or CT) allow diagnosis. Depending on the type of tumor, animals can do well if they are treated early.\nElectromyography, including electrical stimulation of the facial nerve, may be helpful to determine the severity of the injury. There is no specific therapy for injury except electroacupuncture, massage, heat applied to the affected muscles, laser therapy, and low level light therapy. Some animals may also need special water containers and soft food. The facial nerve can slowly regenerate, so repeated neurologic examinations can help determine if an animal is recovering. If there has been no improvement after 6 months, the chance of recovery is poor.",
