       "  'content': 'Here are some articles you might find useful for the following user query: /nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/normal-social-behavior-and-behavioral-problems-of-domestic-animals/behavioral-problems-of-dogs\\nname: Behavioral Problems of Dogs\\ndocument: When behavior of dogs is undesirable, there are three levels of consideration: 1) Behaviors within the normal range for the species, age, and breed. In these cases, the owners need guidance on how to effectively manage the behaviors. 2) Behaviors more difficult or challenging, because they might fall within or just beyond the range of what is considered normal but are particularly intense or difficult to manage. Examples include mouthing, urine marking, mounting, barking, chasing, predation, or overactivity. Also in this category might be what could be normal for the breed but unsuitable for the family and home (ie, mismatch). These cases require behavior assessment and counseling to ensure the owners have a realistic understanding of what might be achieved and to implement treatment strategies, including environmental management and behavior modification, to achieve an acceptable level of improvement for both the owners and the pet. 3) Behaviors that are abnormal or pathologic, as a result of emotional disorders or mental health issues. These may have developed as a result of genetic factors, stressful perinatal environment (prenatal, neonatal), insufficient early socialization, medical conditions affecting brain health and development, or particularly traumatic environmental events. For these pets, the prognosis may be guarded, and owner expectations altered to achieve an acceptable outcome. Treatment generally requires both environmental management and behavioral modification, often in combination with medication (natural products, diet, drugs) to improve underlying pathology and facilitate learning.  The process to diagnose behavior problems and their treatment with behavior modification and drugs has been previously described ( see Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals). If the problem is determined to be a normal but undesirable behavior, the owners will need counseling on how to effectively provide for the pet’s needs and how to reinforce what is desirable while preventing what is undesirable. For most canine behavior management problems, counseling from veterinary staff or trainers and quality resources are required, as well as hands-on guidance from a trainer. Trainers should be selected based on their credentials and screened to ensure they use reinforcement-based training techniques. Positive punishment−based techniques should not be used in training, because at best they serve only to suppress undesirable behavior and can lead to fear, avoidance, and even aggression. Management issues include inappropriate play (eg, nipping or mouthing of people); unruly behavior (eg, pulling, lunging, jumping up, mounting, overactivity); and some forms of barking, destructive behaviors, and housesoiling.  If the problem is determined to be an emotional disorder or abnormal behavior, resolution will require a combination of behavior modification techniques, modifications to the environment to prevent further problems, and medications to help reestablish a more normal mental state and facilitate new learning ( see Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals).  ## Fears and Phobias Fear is a normal response to an actual or\\xa0perceived threatening stimulus or situation. Anxiety is a response to fear and agitation, or apprehension when the animal anticipates a threat or fearful situation. Phobia is an exaggerated fear response ( see Phobia). The fear response may include panting and salivation, tucked tail, lowered ears, gazing away, low body posture, piloerection, vocalization, or displacement behaviors such as yawning or lip licking. While avoidance and escape is one strategy, some dogs use aggression to remove the fear-evoking stimulus and are reinforced by success (negative reinforcement).  Some of the more common presentations include the following: 1) fear of other dogs, especially those that are unfamiliar, appear threatening to the dog, or with which the dog has had an unpleasant experience; 2) fear of unfamiliar people, especially those who are novel or look, act, or smell different than those the dog is accustomed to (eg, young children); 3) fear of inanimate stimuli such as loud or unfamiliar noises (eg, construction work, trucks, gunshot), visual stimuli (eg, umbrellas, hats, uniforms), environments (eg, backyard, park, boarding kennel), surfaces (eg, grass, tile or wood floors, steps), or a combination of stimuli (eg, vacuum cleaners, car rides); and 4) fear of specific situations such as veterinary clinics or grooming parlors. Some dogs have a more generalized anxiety, in which the fearful reaction is displayed in a wide range of situations to which a “normal” pet would be unlikely to react. Although there can be a genetic component to fear and anxiety, prenatal and neonatal stressors, including maternal separation, lack of socialization (ie, unfamiliarity), or a previous unpleasant outcome during encounters with the stimulus (or similar stimuli), can also be causative factors.  Phobic responses in dogs are generally associated with loud noises (eg, thunder, fireworks, gunshots) and the stimuli associated with these events, including rain, lightning, and perhaps even static or pressure changes associated with a thunderstorm. Some fears (eg, veterinary clinics, going outdoors, entering certain rooms, or walking on certain types of flooring) may become so intense that they meet the definition of a phobia.  ### Separation Anxiety: It is estimated that ~14% of dogs have separation anxiety, or an inability of the pet to find comfort when separated from family members. The problem may be primary (eg, hyperattachment, dysfunctional attachment) as the puppy ages and matures; in fact, the chances of the problem developing can be reduced by having puppies regularly spend time during the day on their own (preferably in a safe haven). In other cases, the anxiety about being left alone is secondary to an event such as a change in the household or dog\\'s daily routine, or associated with an underlying state of anxiety along with other behavioral issues such as noise phobias and separation anxiety. Anxiety may lead to destructive behavior (particularly at exits or toward owner possessions), distress vocalization, housesoiling, salivation, pacing, restlessness, inability to settle, anorexia, and repetitive or compulsive behaviors. The behaviors are exhibited when the dog is left alone and generally arise within the first 15–30 min after departure. A video recording can be an invaluable diagnostic aid to visualize the behavior and determine whether there are other concurrent signs of anxiety (autonomic stimulation, increased motor activity, and increased vigilance and scanning). The diagnosis requires that other common causes of the signs be excluded (eg, incomplete housetraining, exploratory play and scavenging, external stimuli leading to arousal and anxiety, noise aversion, or\\xa0confinement anxiety). Many pets with separation anxiety begin to exhibit signs as the owner prepares to depart (eg, putting on shoes, getting keys, going to the door). When the owner is home, the dog may crave constant contact or proximity to the owner. When the owner returns, the welcoming responses are commonly exaggerated and the dog is hard to calm down. ## Abnormal Repetitive Behaviors Abnormal repetitive behaviors may actually comprise a number of conditions with different pathogeneses, including compulsive disorders, stereotypies, neurologic disorders, and other forms of behavioral pathology. Therefore, until a diagnosis is made, the term abnormal repetitive behavior may better describe the clinical presentation.  Compulsive disorders may be repetitive, stereotypic, locomotory, grooming, ingestive, or hallucinogenic behaviors that occur out of context to the time and situation in which they take place, and occur in a frequency or duration that is excessive. There may be lack of control over onset or termination. Although it can be debated whether animals can obsess, they do perceive and experience concern; therefore, the term obsessive-compulsive has also been used to describe this disorder. The diagnosis should start with a description and observation of the behavior, including video recordings if necessary. Because there is likely a genetic component for many compulsive disorders, the signalment and age of onset is also important. For example, German Shepherds and Bull Terriers are known to spin or tail chase, while a genetic locus for flank sucking has been identified in Doberman Pinschers. The problem may first arise as a displacement behavior when the dog is frustrated, conflicted, or highly aroused. Lack of predictability in the daily routine, alterations in the environment, unpredictable consequences, lack of sufficient outlets for normal behaviors, and chronic or recurrent anxiety might be initiating factors. At this point, if the owners can teach appropriate acceptable alternative responses (eg, sitting before greeting or play as an alternative to spinning) and provide constructive alternatives (eg, feeding from toys), the problem might be resolved. However, as the frequency or intensity increases, the behavior may become compulsive. The diagnosis is considered to be a compulsive disorder when the behavior interferes with normal function or when it becomes independent of (or emancipated from) the inciting stimulus. There is likely altered serotonin transmission.  Stereotypies are defined as repetitive behaviors that are unvaried in sequence and have no obvious purpose or function. They may arise when the environment lacks sufficient outlets for the dog to engage in normal behaviors, or when caused by maternal deprivation or as a result of a neurologic disorder. It is possible that stereotypic behaviors, at least in their early stages, may provide a coping mechanism for the pet. Stereotypies might be induced by dopaminergic stimulation.  Although most dogs respond to drugs that inhibit serotonin reuptake including the SSRIs and clomipramine, alterations in other neurotransmitters may play a role, eg, dopamine, endorphins, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA). Because medical problems might be the cause of the signs, these should first be excluded. In cases in which the physical examination, history, and diagnostic testing do not clearly identify the cause, a therapeutic response trial might be indicated (eg, anticonvulsants to exclude focal seizures as a cause of fly snapping or light chasing; clomipramine or fluoxetine to exclude compulsive disorders). Also see Table: Clinical Presentation and Medical Differentials for Compulsive Disorders. ## Aggression Aggression is the most common problem in referral practices across North America, approximating 70% of the caseload. It is also a major human concern, because at least 5\\xa0million people are referred to the hospital each year in the USA alone for treatment of dog bites. Most forms of aggression, except for predation, are distance-increasing behavior (ie, the dog is attempting to actively increase the distance between itself and the stimulus). There are many types of aggressive behaviors with different motivations; however, fear, anxiety, conflict (uncertainty), genetics, and learned responses generally play a role in most cases; however, in some cases the behavior may be abnormal or pathologic. The effects of early development (prenatal, postnatal), socialization, and previous experience all play a role in development of aggression.  Aggression refers to threatening behavior or harmful attacks and can range from subtle changes in body posture, facial expressions, and vocalization to biting. Dogs that are easily aroused are at high risk of aggression, because their decision-making is affected by their physiologic state (ie, flight or fight). For treatment to be effective, the pet’s anxiety and arousal must first be managed by avoiding situations or staying below the threshold at which aggression might arise. Some or all of a combination of reward-based training, behavior products that can help to better manage the pet, and medications to help achieve a behavioral state most conducive to new learning is required to successfully modify the behavior to achieve desirable outcomes and countercondition the pet to the stimuli that incite aggression.  Before treating aggression, the practitioner must assess the potential risk of injury. All stimuli that might incite aggression should be accurately identified to ensure initial safety. Predictability is a critical issue in prognosis, both to prevent further incidents and to develop a stimulus gradient for treatment. The signalment, environment, history, and target of the aggression also provide invaluable information as to whether the problem might be safely and effectively managed. The type of aggression is an additional factor: some can be managed and improved, whereas others require prevention. Finally, the clinician must assess the ability of the owner to effectively and safely prevent the problem. Aggression that is unpredictable, arises during relatively benign interactions, involves targets that cannot realistically avoid exposure to the aggressive dog (eg, young children, other household pets), or is performed by a large dog or in an uninhibited manner worsens the prognosis. Any medical condition that might cause or contribute to aggression must be identified, because they are important factors in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. (See www.esvce.org for risk assessment guidelines.)  ### Fear-related Aggression: Fear is the underlying cause of most forms of canine aggression. It is triggered by a stimulus that is threatening to the dog. When the aggression is a direct response to a challenge or confrontation, it might be referred to as defensive aggression. Fearful dogs may try to avoid the stimulus but become aggressive if they cannot escape (eg, leashed, confined, cornered, or physically grasped), are motivated to maintain their place (eg, on property, between the owner and stimulus, near food or toy), or if they learn that aggression is successful at removing the threat. Inadequate socialization, learning, genetics (temperament), reinforcement of aggressive behavior (eg, retreat of the stimulus), and associating a negative outcome with the stimulus (eg, punishment) can all lead to the development of fear-related aggression. The diagnosis is based on identifying signs of fear as well as the history beginning with the first event, because dogs can exhibit fear at the initial exposure but with time may display a more offensive form of aggression (without threats) when they learn it can be successful. (For treatment of fear-related and other types of aggression, see Treatment of Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, and Aggression.) ### Possessive Aggression (Resource Guarding): Possessive aggression is most likely to arise when a person or an animal approaches the dog while it is in possession of something it wants to retain. Pets in the process of ingesting or chewing an object might be more likely to display aggression, but the behavior can also be seen in dogs near an object. Aggression is most commonly displayed when in possession of highly motivating food, treats, chew toys, stolen items, or even sleeping places. While genetics and early experience play a role in development, the relative value of the object to the pet and the threat of losing the object to another dog or person determine whether the pet is likely to be possessive. Items that are novel or scarce may be more desirable. Fear and defensive behavior also play a role if the owners threaten, punish, or confront the pet when it takes an object or has it in its mouth. The dog may also learn that it can successfully retain the object with aggression.  The problem might be prevented by tossing the puppy high-value treats whenever the owner approaches or passes by the food bowl, and by offering a high-value treat or toy whenever the puppy voluntarily gives up another toy or chew. Food bowls, toys, and chews should not be removed by confrontation, because this can contribute to an increase in anxiety and aggression when approached. In adult dogs, the problem should be managed by preventing access to these items or confining the dog when it is given items over which it might be possessive and by training the dog to give and drop on cue (beginning with items of low value for high-value rewards). If safety is an issue (ie, the dog may hurt itself by chewing on the item), it may be possible to trade the object for one of higher value. Providing more toys and multiple small meals (eg, in feeding toys) may reduce the value and novelty of the resource. ### Play Aggression: Aggressive play is a normal puppy behavior, which may persist into adulthood as a result of genetics, neotinization, and learning. When puppies play aggressively with other puppies, they may nip and bite but will generally resolve the conflicts among themselves. However, if the problem becomes excessive, owner intervention may be required to redirect the dog’s activities into other forms of play (eg, feeding toys) or to interrupt the behavior with commands or a leash and head halter. If play with people escalates to biting, the interaction can be immediately stopped (negative punishment) and resumed when oral play ceases (positive reinforcement). Alternatively, a leash and head halter or verbal distraction (\"off\") can be used to interrupt play biting. In all interactions, the puppy should be taught to sit before given anything of value (eg, food, toys, affection). In addition, the puppy should be engaged in regular alternative acceptable forms of play, including fetch, tug games, and manipulation and chew toys. Punishment should not be used to stop play, because it can lead to fear of the owner, defensive aggression, or conflict-induced aggression, or serve as inadvertent reinforcement for some puppies. ### Redirected Aggression: Aggression is directed toward a third party when the dog is prevented or unable to exhibit aggression to its primary target. This type of aggression is most commonly described when the dog bites the owner as he or she grasps or restrains the dog when trying to prevent or break up a dog fight. Similarly, dogs that might be aggressive toward a veterinarian might bite the person restraining the dog. Redirected aggression arises as a result of the frustration or interruption of other forms of aggression or arousal. ### Irritable/Conflict/Impulse Control Aggression: Aggression directed toward family members is often mislabeled as dominance or status-related aggression. However, aggression toward family members generally arises from fearful or defensive behaviors, resource guarding, redirected behavior, or situations of conflict (competing emotional states and unpredictable consequences). In some dogs, the problem may be traced back to the owner’s attempts to inhibit excessive play aggression (see above).  When a dog successfully uses aggression to achieve a goal (retaining a resource) or remove a threat, the pet learns that aggression is successful (negative reinforcement). If the owner continues to threaten, confront, challenge, or punish the pet, some dogs may inhibit their responses, but a large proportion become more aggressively defensive. When dogs are resting or sleeping, chewing on a favored object, or no longer desirous of human affection, they may respond with either deferent displays or threats. However, if the owner continues to approach, tries to remove the resource, or attempts to pet the dog despite its signaling, aggression may escalate and future signaling may be lost. The owner-pet relationship can quickly deteriorate as the dog becomes more wary and defensive while the owner becomes more fearful and/or confrontational.  Genetic factors and early experience likely also play a role; many of these dogs are easily aroused, excessively fearful, or may have emotional disorders or behavioral pathology (see below). Other cases are primarily a result of learning. Aggression when grabbing the collar or during bathing, nail trimming, or ear cleaning is a defensive response. Interrupting a pet that is aroused may lead to redirected aggression. Therefore, when a dog is presented for aggression toward family members, it can be difficult to determine the dog’s underlying motivation because each incident has added to prior learning, fear conditioning, and underlying conflict. Dominance might refer to the relationship between two individuals of the same species within a social group, as described by actions, interactions, and intraspecific communication/signaling. These relationships are not established by aggression of the dominant individual but rather by the deferent signaling of others. Relationships between species, particularly dogs and people, are established through early socialization, the personality of the individual, and what it learns from its observations and interactions with family members. Physical techniques intended to assert dominance (eg, pinning, rolling over) and verbal discipline (yelling \"no\") are therefore ill advised and can result in fear, anxiety, and further aggression.  Dogs with impulse control aggression may respond with aggression to relatively benign interactions with family members. In some lines of English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels, this aggression is associated with alterations in serotonin in blood samples or CSF.  When aggression is excessive, unpredictable, and disproportionate to the level of threat, safety is a serious concern and the prognosis generally guarded. However, when behavior is abnormal or pathologic, substantial improvement might be achieved with a combination of drugs (eg, SSRIs) and behavior modification. ### Aggression Toward Other Dogs: Dogs in the same group or household usually avoid conflict without aggression. Communication is based on dominant and submissive signals, with the deference of one of the two individuals to avoid escalation of the encounter. Dominance is a relative concept—the dog that displays deferent signaling may vary between resources and situations. Aggression between individuals living in the same household is generally an abnormal behavior caused by fear and anxiety, redirected aggression, impulse dyscontrol, or poor intraspecific communication skills as a result of genetics or lack of early socialization and compounded by experience and learning. Redirected aggression and competition over a valued resource may also lead to aggression between dogs in the home.  Owners may play a role by inadvertently supporting or encouraging a dog during an encounter in which it would normally defer. Age or illness may also play a role, if the way in which one dog signals or responds to the other is altered. Male-to-male aggression may have underlying hormonal factors that can be improved by neutering; however, learning may play a role in maintaining aggression.  If any situations arise in which the dogs are unable to resolve conflicts without aggression or injury, behavioral guidance should be sought. Aggression toward unfamiliar dogs and those that are not members of the family group are likely fearful, possessive, protective, or territorial. ### Territorial/Protective Aggression: Aggression may be displayed when the dog is approached in its territory. Territory can be stationary (eg, yard, home) or mobile (eg, car). What defines the behavior as territorial is that the dog does not display fear to similar stimuli when outside its territory. Fear, anxiety, defensive, and possessive behaviors may all be components, because the pet is most likely to display the behavior toward unfamiliar stimuli, and the motivation to escape or avoid (flight) is decreased or absent when the pet is on its own property. Learning (negative reinforcement when the stimulus retreats) and fear conditioning (unpleasant outcomes such as yelling, discipline, and confinement) can also play a role. ### Predatory Aggression: This is one of the most dangerous types of aggression, because there is usually no warning. The attack is intended to kill prey, and the bite is uninhibited. The sequence of events may include stalking, chasing, biting, and killing. Young children and babies may be at risk because their size and behaviors mimic those of prey. Although extensive socialization to a species might reduce predation toward that species, the behavior may be enhanced when predatory individuals are together in a group. Predation is a normal and dangerous canine behavior; thus, any dog that exhibits the behavior must be prevented from opportunities to repeat it. ### Pain-induced and Medical Causes of Aggression: Any disease that causes pain or increases irritability (eg, dental disease, arthritis, trauma, allergies) can lead to aggression. The dog may become aggressive when it is handled or anticipates handling. Organ dysfunction (eg, renal, hepatic), CNS disease, and endocrinopathies (eg, hyperadrenocorticism, functional testicular and ovarian tumors, and thyroid dysfunction) might also contribute to irritability and aggression. (Also .) While hypothyroidism is more likely associated with lethargy, dermatologic signs, and heat seeking in the early stages, it has been suggested that dogs might display an increase in aggression, particularly toward family members. Treatment should likely be reserved for cases in which diagnostic tests are also consistent with hypothyroidism, because excessive supplementation could lead to a hyperthyroid state (with associated medical and behavioral consequences). Treating the medical problem may resolve the aggression, but the behavior, once learned, may persist. ### Maternal Aggression: Maternal aggression may be seen in intact females with a litter of puppies or in females with pseudocyesis. It can be directed toward people or other animals. Signs of aggression arise when the bitch’s puppies or toys that mimic puppies are protected, and the aggression should resolve when the hormonal state returns to normal and/or the puppies are weaned. The term maternal aggression has also been used to describe the aggression or cannibalism directed toward the puppies by the bitch. Although the problem may have a genetic component, it is reported to occur more frequently after a first litter. Ovariohysterectomy can prevent further incidents. ## Treatment of Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, and Aggression Before implementing specific therapy to manage, improve, or resolve a behavior problem, some common elements that apply to most cases should be considered. The initial discussion should focus on 1) an understanding of normal behavior as it relates to the problem, 2) learning to read canine body language and facial expressions, 3) ensuring that all of the dog’s needs are adequately being met, 4) reviewing the principles of learning and reinforcement-based training (predictable consequences), and 5) managing both the environment and the dog to prevent further incidents. The cause, diagnosis, and motivation behind the behavior should be reviewed. Finally, the owner should be given a prognosis with realistic expectations for both short- and longterm outcomes.  In most cases, treatment focuses on changing the dog’s emotional response with the stimulus (counterconditioning) and/or replacing the undesirable response with one that is desirable using reinforcement-based techniques (response substitution). However, dogs that are highly aroused respond with autonomic fight-or-flight responses and tend to make reflexive responses. Therefore, arousal must be reduced before treatment can proceed. This can be achieved by training the dog to settle on cue, by minimizing the intensity of the stimulus during exposure (desensitization), or by using management devices such as head halters that can change the dog’s focus and help it to settle, and with drugs or natural products that reduce anxiety and behavioral pathology. Early intervention with medication may be necessary to achieve success and can be in the best interest of the fearful, anxious, or phobic dog.  There are common elements to the treatment of fear, anxiety, phobias, and most types of aggression. The first step in the treatment program is to identify each situation stimulus or interaction in which the problem might arise, so that a preventive program can first be implemented. Prevention ensures safety (eg, in aggression cases), prevents further damage to the household or injury to the dog, avoids further anxiety-evoking situations for the dog, and ensures no further aggravation of the problem through fear conditioning (ie, unpleasant outcomes) and learning (ie, negative reinforcement if the stimulus retreats).  Prevention can be most effectively achieved by identifying and avoiding any situation in which the dog might be exposed to the stimulus. A leash and head harness, leash and body harness, or verbal commands (when effective) can also prevent access to the stimulus. If avoidance cannot be ensured and aggression is a possibility, then a basket muzzle might be the best alternative.  A common starting point to begin to reduce anxiety, improve communication and training, teach self-control, and allow the dog to control its consequences/outcomes is to establish a program of structured interactions in which the dog is not given anything it values (or wants) until it sits (or lies down). If the owners\\' response is consistent and predictable by ensuring the dog sits (or lies down) every time a treat (food or toy) is given, the leash is attached, the dog goes in and out of the door or car, or the dog wants affection, the dog will soon learn that the sit or down action is required to get the reward, at which point gradually longer and more relaxed responses can be taught. This is sometimes termed structured interactions, predictable consequences, learn to earn, or “saying please.”  Because the ultimate goal is to successfully expose the dog to controlled levels of the stimuli while achieving calm and positive outcomes, it is necessary to determine what behaviors need to be trained to achieve desirable outcomes during exposure training. For example, if problems arise indoors, the dog may first need to learn a focused sit, a relaxed down, and a mat command (or other location such as room or crate). A drop or give command and a come or recall may also need to be trained. When problems arise outdoors, sit and focus or down and settle may also be useful, but loose leash walking, backing up, or turning and walking away may be the best options for stimulus exposure. These behaviors should be learned reliably and consistently in a variety of environments with a minimum of distractions before the owners proceed to a graduated stimulus exposure ( see Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals and see Modification).  By identifying a range (gradient) of the dog’s most favored rewards, the most desirable can be used for training and shaping new behaviors that approximate the final goal; less-motivating rewards can then be used to ensure immediacy and timing of previously learned commands. In addition, a way to minimize and control the intensity of the stimulus will also need to be designed (eg, volume, distance, location). Exposure exercises can then be implemented by setting up situations in which high-value rewards are used to reinforce the desired behavior and condition a positive response during exposure to low-intensity stimuli and gradually proceeding through more intense stimuli. Setbacks can be avoided by determining the level of stimulus intensity at which a calm and positive outcome can be achieved and reinforced, and with the use of management devices such as a head halter (sit, reorient head, turn and walk away) or front control body harness (turn away from the situation) to ensure safety and success. Drugs and natural therapeutics might be used concurrently in dogs with excessively intense or abnormal behaviors to enable the successful implementation of behavior modification.  For noise phobias, controlled exposure can best be achieved through recordings that can be gradually increased after each successful session of desensitization and counterconditioning. Concurrent behavioral management to reduce stimuli (with sound proofing, ear covers, eye covers, crate covers, or white noise) and develop a safe haven to help the dog settle might also help the dog to cope. For separation anxiety, once a regular routine of play, exercise, and training is established, any additional reinforcement should focus on shaping gradually longer inattention sessions when the dog rests or occupies itself with favored chew and food- or treat-filled toys, ideally in a comfortable safe haven (bed, crate, or room) where the owners can house the dog while gradually increasing their time away. Any attention- or affection-soliciting behavior should be ignored, unless the dog is sitting or lying down calmly (sit for all interactions) or resting on its bed or mat. Visual and auditory cues that signal departure should be avoided if possible; alternatively, they can be decoupled from departure by exposing the dog while remaining home, and associating with play and treats (counterconditioning). In addition to preventive and environmental management strategies and behavior modification, drugs or natural therapeutics can be used to reduce underlying fear, anxiety, arousal, reactivity, or impulse dyscontrol to help facilitate learning; to improve underlying behavioral pathology; and in many cases to improve the behavioral well-being of the dog.  For impulsivity, generalized anxiety disorders, excessive stimulus anxiety, and phobias, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are commonly used. Because fluoxetine has been evaluated in and licensed for dogs, it is generally the first choice of the SSRIs, although fluvoxamine, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram might be alternatives when fluoxetine is insufficiently effective or adverse effects such as anorexia are an issue. SSRIs are also used to treat compulsive disorders. Among the TCAs, clomipramine is licensed for use in dogs and is an alternative to fluoxetine for the treatment of anxiety disorders and phobias. Because clomipramine is the most selective of the TCAs to inhibit serotonin reuptake, it could be used for compulsive disorders, as an alternative to SSRIs. Other TCAs might be selected for their more potent antihistaminic effects (eg, doxepin, amitriptyline), whereas imipramine has been used as an aid in improving sphincter control with behavioral incontinence. Although the full effect might not be achieved for 3–4 wk, some effect might be noted in the first week. For some compulsive disorders, especially those in which there is a self-traumatic component, gabapentin or carbamazepine might be used concurrently, whereas in those cases in which focal seizures might be causing the behavioral signs, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or potassium bromide might be used in a therapeutic response trial.  When an anxiety-evoking event can be predicted (eg, thunderstorms, fireworks, owner departure, visit to the veterinarian, car ride, exposure to dogs or strangers on a walk, visitors coming to the home), a benzodiazepine can be given with the antidepressant ~1 hr before the event. Because benzodiazepines have variable effects and relatively short half-lives, their efficacy, dose, and duration should be determined in advance of their therapeutic use. Clonidine, trazodone, or propranolol are other options that might be used adjunctively with SSRIs ~1 hr before an expected fear-evoking event (eg, thunder, fireworks, owner departure). In some refractory anxiety cases, trazodone, clonidine, a benzodiazepine such as clonazepam, or perhaps gabapentin might be used concurrently with an SSRI.  Buspirone, a nonsedating anxiolytic, is another option for ongoing use. Caution should be exercised when using anxiolytics, because some may disinhibit fearful dogs, which could lead to increased confidence and aggression.  Selegiline, which is licensed in North America for treatment of cognitive dysfunction syndrome in dogs, is also licensed for treatment of emotional disorders or chronic anxiety in Europe.  Natural products might be used alone or adjunctively with drugs or other natural products to help calm or reduce anxiety, although evidence of efficacy is more limited. A number of studies support the use of pheromone therapy. Adaptil™ simulates the intermammary-appeasing pheromones produced by the lactating bitch and is available as a spray, diffuser, or collar. Pheromones have been used for anxiety associated with car rides, veterinary visits, separation anxiety, storm and fireworks aversions, and to reduce the stress of adoption and aid socialization. A calming or anxiety-modulating effect has been reported for alpha-casozepine (Zylkene®, a milk protein hydrolysate), Harmonease® (containing Magnolia officinalis and Phellodendron amurense), l-theanine (Anxitane®) and Sin-Susto™ (a Souroubea plant blend), and aromatherapy (with lavender). In addition, studies with l-tryptophan in combination with a low-protein diet have demonstrated a possible reduction in some forms of aggression. A commercial diet also has been developed that combines l-tryptophan and alpha-casozepine (Royal Canin Calm®) that might aid in reducing stress and anxiety. ## Hyperactivity Although hyperactivity or attention deficit disorder has been poorly documented in dogs, there have been published cases studies of dogs with excessive motor activity and an altered ability to acquire new tasks (learn), sometimes accompanied by stereotypic behaviors. It may be particularly difficult to train such dogs to behaviorally settle. There may also be signs of sympathetic activity even at rest (eg, increased heart and respiratory rate, vasodilation). Affected dogs may respond to treatment with methylphenidate. If no improvement with an initial dose of 0.25–0.5 mg/kg, bid, the dosage can be gradually increased every few days to a maximum of ~2 mg/kg until a measurable therapeutic response is seen (reduced motor activity, heart rate, respiratory rate, repetitive activities), provided no adverse effects develop. Differential diagnoses include impulse control disorders that might respond to SSRI therapy, and normal behaviors in dogs with behavioral needs that are not being adequately met. In fact, it can be quite challenging to meet these needs in some breeds and individuals, depending on the home and family. ## Destructive Behaviors Many of the destructive behaviors, including chewing, stealing, garbage raiding, and digging, are normal exploratory behaviors that arise when the dog is unsupervised and not otherwise engaged in more desirable activities. A regular daily routine with sufficient reward training, exercise, and social enrichment can help to ensure that these behaviors do not arise when the owners are home, although varying degrees of supervision may be required. When the owners cannot supervise the dog, it should be provided with adequate outlets for exploratory play in the form of chews, food-stuffed toys, or manipulation toys, or in the case of outdoor dogs, perhaps even a designated area for digging. These dogs may also need to be confined away from the areas in which problems might arise or housed in crates, pens, or runs to prevent access to potential targets of destruction. Some dogs engage in destructive behaviors because of anxiety (eg, separation anxiety, confinement, noise phobias). Together with the history, videotaping or camera monitoring is generally the best way to diagnose behavior problems that occur when the owner is absent, as well as assess response to treatment. ## Eating Disorders Behavioral problems related to ingestion include those in which food intake is excessive (polyphagia), inadequate (hyporexia), or too fast (gorging); water intake is excessive (polydipsia); and nonfood items (pica) or feces (coprophagia) are eaten. Medical causes should be excluded first. Some dogs that scavenge do so as a normal component of food acquisition and are reinforced by success. Coprophagia may occasionally have a medical cause, but normal maternal behavior includes consumption of feces and urine of young puppies. In addition, as part of exploratory behavior, many dogs are attracted to and may ingest feces, compost, and prey (dead or live). Similarly, although some dogs with pica and polyphagia have compulsive disorders, many dogs, especially puppies, begin to chew and ingest nonfood items as part of investigative and exploratory behavior.  Dogs with hyporexia may have an anxiety disorder, and some may develop specific taste preferences and aversions that reduce what they will eat.  Many feeding problems can be improved through a work-for-food program in which dogs are given food as reinforcers for training, with the balance placed inside toys that require chewing or manipulation to release the food. This encourages exploration, makes feeding an enjoyable, time-consuming, and mentally challenging activity, and can limit the quantity consumed and prevent gorging. As with most behavior problems, correcting feeding problems needs to be accompanied by management strategies to prevent access to potential targets at any time the dog cannot be supervised or actively engaged in other chew and play behaviors. ## Elimination Behavioral Problems ### Housesoiling: Dogs may soil in inappropriate locations because of inadequate or insufficient training, as a marking behavior, or as a result of fear or anxiety. However, pain, sensory decline, cerebrocortical disease including cognitive dysfunction, or any medical condition that leads to increased volume, more frequent elimination, pain on elimination, or lack of control, must first be excluded as potential causes or contributing factors.  A detailed behavioral history is necessary to determine whether the dog has ever been housetrained. If not, a housetraining regimen should be reviewed in which the focus is solely on reinforcement of elimination in desirable locations rather than punishment of elimination in inappropriate locations. This requires the owner to accompany the dog to its elimination area (eg, outdoors), reinforce elimination, supervise the dog indoors to prevent or interrupt any attempts at elimination (perhaps with the aid of a leash to ensure continuous supervision), and return the dog to its elimination site at appropriate intervals or if there are signs that the dog is ready to eliminate (eg, sniffing, heading to the door, sneaking away). When the owner is not able to supervise, a combination of scheduling (ensuring that the dog eliminates before departure and having someone return to take the dog to its elimination area before it must eliminate) and confinement training/prevention are required.  Dogs can either be confined away from areas where they might eliminate or kept in an area where they will not eliminate, such as a pen, room, or crate, where the dog eats, plays, or sleeps. Alternatively, the dog can be provided with an indoor elimination area (eg, paper, indoor puppy potty) within its confinement area where it can relieve itself when the owner is gone. Puppies obtained from pet stores or any location where they have been extensively caged may be more difficult to housetrain, because they have never had to inhibit elimination and may have learned to play with or eat feces. ### Marking Behavior: Although marking is most often seen in intact males as a form of social and olfactory communication, it is also seen in females (especially when in heat) and in neutered males and females, often as an overmarking of other odors (eg, where other pets have urinated, or on items such as blankets with the residual odor of other dogs, people, or cats). Some dogs will mark when they visit unfamiliar households, especially when another dog’s odor is present. There is often a typical posture of a raised or partially raised leg when the surface to be marked is vertical. Fecal marking is uncommon.  Although marking is likely a component of normal communication, it is unacceptable when it occurs indoors. Neutering intact males will reduce the behavior, and good supervision can prevent or inhibit most marking. As with housesoiling, dogs should be confined away from areas that might be marked when owners are not able to supervise. Marking that is related to anxiety may be reduced by identifying and treating the cause, perhaps with the aid of\\xa0drugs or natural products that reduce anxiety. ### Excitement, Submission, and Conflict-related Elimination: Dogs may eliminate when they are overly excited, such as when greeting people. Some dogs will urinate when showing submissive postures (eg, crouching to the ground or turning over to expose the belly) or when highly aroused. Because loss of urine control may be associated with a concurrent desire to both greet and show deferential behavior, many cases may be due to conflicting behavioral motivations. Treatment should focus on avoiding the stimuli (reaching, approach, eye contact) that incite the behavior and avoiding any punishment during greeting, which would add to fear and conflict behaviors. Acceptable alternative behaviors that are incompatible with excitable greeting or deferent postures can be taught, such as a relaxed sit, or any game or “trick” the pet may have learned such as fetch or giving a paw. Phenylpropanolamine might increase sphincter control, whereas imipramine may improve control and reduce anxiety. ### Other Elimination Disorders: Dogs with separation anxiety or other fears and phobias (eg, thunderstorm phobia, firework phobia) may soil during these times. ## Aging and Cognitive Dysfunction The aging process is associated with progressive and irreversible changes in body systems that can affect behavior ( see Medical Causes of Behavioral Signs and see Medical Causes of Behavioral Signs). In older dogs, these might include hepatic or renal failure, endocrine disorders (eg, Cushing disease), pain, sensory decline, or any disease affecting the CNS (eg, tumors) or circulation (eg, anemia, hypertension). To diagnose the cause of behavioral signs in a geriatric dog, a detailed history, physical examination, neurologic evaluation, and diagnostic tests are required to exclude potential medical causes of the presenting signs. Many owners do not report these signs, perhaps because the owners think they are insignificant or assume little can be done. Yet in one study, 30% of dogs 11–12 yr old and nearly 70% of dogs 15–16 yr old had signs consistent with cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). A more recent Internet survey estimated CDS in 14.2% of dogs >10 yr old, with prevalence increasing with age, but >85% of these had not been diagnosed. It is therefore essential that owners be informed of the importance of reporting signs when they arise and for veterinarians to take a proactive approach in asking owners about behavior at each visit. Early detection provides the best opportunity to improve signs and slow the decline of cognitive function.  Aging dogs may exhibit a decline in cognitive function (memory, learning, perception, awareness) that manifests as one or more of a group of clinical signs. These are sometimes referred to by the acronym DISHA and include disorientation, interactions, sleep-wake cycles, housesoiling, and activity changes (which may be decreased or increased and repetitive). In addition, anxiety, agitation, and altered responses to stimuli are frequently reported. The first and most prominent sign of brain aging is a decline in learning or memory, which is generally impractical for pet owners to assess. However, neuropsychologic testing of older dogs has documented memory decline beginning at 6–8 yr of age and learning deficits by 9 yr of age. CDS in dogs is analogous to the early stages of Alzheimer disease in people, both in clinical signs and brain pathology. As with people, some dogs show minimal to no clinical impairment with age, whereas others develop varying degrees of deficits.  Treatment should first focus on environmental enrichment (both physical and mental stimulation), which has been shown to slow cognitive decline and improve the signs of CDS. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor that may improve the signs of CDS by enhancing dopamine and other catecholamines in the cortex and hippocampus and by decreasing free radical load. Propentofylline, which is licensed in Europe and Australia for the treatment of dullness, lethargy, and depressed demeanor in old dogs, may increase blood flow and inhibit platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.  A number of natural products, including diets and supplements, have also been shown to have beneficial effects in improving the signs and potentially slowing cognitive decline. Two such diets are Canine b/d®, which is supplemented with fatty acids, antioxidants, and dl-alpha-lipoic acid and l-carnitine to enhance mitochondrial function, and a specialized Purina One® diet that uses botanic oils containing medium-chain triglycerides to provide ketone bodies as an alternative source of energy for aging neurons.  Other natural supplements that have demonstrated efficacy in improving cognitive function include Senilife®, which contains a combination of phosphatidylserine, Ginkgo biloba, resveratrol, and vitamins E and B6; Activait®, which contains phosphatidylserine in combination with α-lipoic acid, carnitine, fatty acids, glutathione, and other antioxidants; S-adenosyl methionine (Novifit®); and apoaequorin (Neutricks®), a calcium-buffering protein found in jellyfish.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/behavior-of-dogs/behavior-modification-in-dogs\\nname: Behavior Modification in Dogs\\ndocument: The techniques used most commonly to modify dog behavior include habituation, extinction, desensitization, counterconditioning, response substitution, and shaping. A behavior modification technique called flooding, described below, is not used very often because it is more likely to make animals worse. While it is claimed that punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people use punishment correctly. For punishment (such as screaming at the dog) to be successful, it\\xa0must occur at the beginning of the behavior, be consistently delivered, and be strong enough to stop the unwanted behavior. Most punishments are not given at the right time or are not the appropriate type for the situation. \"Dominance\" training techniques that encourage owners to assert leadership through physical confrontations are also not recommended. Multiple studies have shown that training based on punishments or confrontations are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression. Dogs trained with rewards have fewer behavioral problems and are less fearful.  ## Behavior Modification Techniques Most of the techniques involved in behavior modification are not hard to learn and can be successfully used as preventive techniques. They do require a regular investment of time and effort, however. The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in these techniques.  Habituation is a simple form of learning that involves no rewards. It is merely the ending of or decrease in a response to a situation that results from repeated or prolonged exposure to that situation. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road may at first run away when traffic passes, but eventually learn to ignore it. A dog that habituates to one type of sound does not, as a consequence of this habituation, automatically become habituated to other sounds. Habituation is not the same as failing to respond to stimulation as a result of fatigue, sensory adaptation, or injury. The effects of habituation are generally long lasting. However, if an animal is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful stimulus (such as a predator) without being harmed, habituation does not generally occur. Because of this, scientists believe that responses to dangerous stimuli may have an inherited resistance to habituation. If the fearful response is too intense, the dog may become more fearful instead of adjusting to the stimulus.  Spontaneous recovery is associated with habituation. If there is a long period of time between when a dog has experienced an event to which it had habituated and re-exposure to the same event, the dog may again react. For example, a puppy barks to get a reaction. The more the owner attempts to quiet it, the more the puppy barks. It will continue this pattern because it is getting the attention it wanted. Even if the attention is “negative,” some puppies will find it rewarding. The best method to discourage the behavior is to ignore it. Eventually the puppy stops barking if the owner consistently ignores it. However, the bad behavior comes back every now and then. This is called spontaneous recovery.  Conditioning refers to associations between stimuli and behavior. For example, a hungry dog drools (the behavior) when it sees food (the stimulus). After this, every time that the hungry dog sees the food a bell is rung (a second stimulus). Once the food and bell have been paired several times, the dog will drool even if it just hears the bell. This is called conditioning. The bell generates the same response as the sight of food. After several times, the dog has learned to associate the bell with the food. Conditioning can be positive or negative. For example, the sound of a doorbell can cause fear or excitement in a dog, depending on whether the dog likes or dislikes visitors.  Reinforcement is any event that increases the chances that a certain behavior will be repeated. Reinforcements can be positive or negative. When positive reinforcement (a reward) is used in training, there is a positive relationship between the behavior and its consequences. The more the pet does a behavior, the more it gets positive reinforcement. This makes that behavior increase. A negative reinforcement (which\\xa0is mistakenly thought of as punishment by many people) is something unpleasant that increases a behavior when it is removed. For example, being held tightly may be unpleasant to a squirming puppy. But the hold is released only when the puppy calms down. After several times, the release from restraint will increase the chance that the puppy will relax faster.  Second-order reinforcers are signals that can be used at a distance to let the dog know that a reward is coming. Commonly used second-order reinforcers are words, such as “good girl,” hand signals, and clickers. By carefully pairing these with a primary reward (such as food or petting), second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would. For example, a clicker can be associated with patting on the head as a reward for sitting and staying. By associating the clicker with a reward, you can train the dog to sit and stay from farther away and still reward the behavior by using the clicker. Positive training and clicker training have become very popular. However, it is possible to do an excellent job at positive training without using any second-order reinforcers. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing. In some situations involving problem behaviors, the incorrect use of a clicker may hinder, rather than help, a behavior\\xa0modification program.  Extinction is a response that stops when a reward is removed. A classic example of extinction involves a dog that jumps up on people for attention. If people pet the dog, the behavior continues. If they stop petting the dog, the dog will eventually stop jumping up because the reward is no longer there. However, even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping will reinforce the pattern. The more valuable the original reward, the longer it has been present, and the more uncertainty there is about whether the reward has been truly removed, the greater the resistance to extinction. Resistance to extinction can also occur even without reinforcement if the reward was good enough and was tightly linked to the behavior.  Because there is often an association between getting the reward and the intensity of the behavior, the intensity or frequency of the behavior you are trying to eliminate usually increases at the beginning of extinction. In other words, a behavior you are trying to extinguish may get worse before it gets better. It is critical that you do not give in. Giving in will only make extinction more difficult. The dog will learn that, although your threshold has increased, the dog can override it by working harder.  Overlearning is the repeated performance of an already learned behavior. It is frequently used in training for specific events, and may also be useful for preventing fearful responses in dogs. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, it increases the resistance to extinction, and it increases the chance that the behavior will become an automatic or “knee-jerk” response in similar situations. This aspect can be extremely useful in teaching a dog to overcome a fear or anxiety.  Shaping is a learning technique that works well for dogs that do not know what response is desired by the trainer. Shaping works through gradual approximations and allows the dog to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For example, when teaching a puppy to sit, giving the puppy a food treat for squatting will increase the chance that squatting will be repeated. This squatting behavior is then rewarded only when it becomes more exaggerated, and finally, when it becomes a true sit.  Desensitization is a way to gradually teach a dog to tolerate a situation by carefully exposing it to that situation in small steps. If a puppy gets overexcited at the sound of the doorbell, a tape recording of the doorbell could help stop the undesirable behavior. If the tape is played very softly at first and then only gradually increased in volume as long as the puppy remains calm, then the puppy may stop reacting to the doorbell.  Counterconditioning is a method for reducing unwanted behavior by teaching the dog to replace it with another more favorable behavior. In the doorbell example above, the puppy will learn faster if it is first taught to sit, stay, and then relax in exchange for a treat. The puppy must be absolutely quiet and calm, and convey by its eyes, body posture, and facial expressions that it would do anything for its owner. Once this behavior is learned, the desensitization is added by playing the tape recording at a gradually increasing volume. If at any time the puppy starts to get too excited, the tape recording should be lowered in volume until the puppy relaxes. Relaxing is the key and is the first step to changing the behavior. Counterconditioning and desensitization can take a lot of time and effort. The exercises must be frequently repeated so that the unwanted behavior decreases until it is no longer a problem.  Flooding is prolonged exposure to a stimulus until the dog eventually stops reacting. This is the opposite of the approach taken in desensitization. It is far more stressful than any of the other treatment strategies and if not used correctly will make things worse. The most common problem is increased fear. This technique should be used only by a professional and only as a last resort.  Punishment is also known as aversive conditioning. It is any unpleasant event that lowers the chance that a behavior will be repeated. Punishment can be positive or negative. Positive punishment refers to applying something unpleasant to decrease a behavior, whereas negative punishment refers to removing something positive to decrease a behavior. Punishment is not the same as negative reinforcement ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). To be most successful, punishment must occur as early as possible (within a few seconds of the start of the behavior), and it must be consistent and appropriate. Critical factors in punishment include timing, consistency, appropriate intensity, and the presence of a reward after the undesirable behavior ends. This is the most frequently ignored part of treatment for people whose pets have behavior problems. Owners often resort to physical punishment as the first choice, but punishment does not need to be physical. Furthermore, punishment is just as hard to use correctly as counterconditioning and desensitization. Punishment is never an “easy out” and has a high chance of failure. It can also lead to other negative consequences, such as increasing the chance of fear or aggression.  The Premack Principle states that more likely behaviors will reinforce less likely behaviors. When misbehaving increases the likelihood that a dog achieves a goal, the more likely the dog is to misbehave. To prevent the misbehavior, the owner can teach the dog an alternative, positive behavior; for example, teaching a dog to sit and stay before allowing it outside may deter bolting.  Response substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desired one. An example is teaching a dog to lay down instead of jumping up. Owners should begin in a calm environment where success is likely, then progress to places with more distractions as the behavior is learned. Dogs may first need to be desensitized to the stimuli for response substitution to be successful. ## Use of Medication to Treat Behavior Problems Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to help treat a behavior problem of your pet. Drug treatment for almost any behavior change is most useful when combined with behavior modification.  In recent years there has been an increase in the use of medication to treat a variety of behavior problems in pets ( see Table: Drugs Used to Treat Behavior Problems in Dogs). There are a number of potential disadvantages to the use of medication for treating these problems, however, and you should know that there is no “magic bullet” that will easily and quickly solve the problem. The limitations of medication use include the potential for adverse effects, cost, the need to treat for a considerable length of time before the medication takes effect, limited information on what medication is most effective, and the potential that the problem will reappear once the medication is withdrawn.  All medications have the potential to cause side effects. Fortunately, most of the modern antianxiety and antidepressant medications used in pets are well tolerated. Gastrointestinal upsets (leading to reduced appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea) are the most common side effects seen. In some pets, decreased activity or lethargy may occur in the first week or so of treatment as the animal adjusts to the medication. (This reaction typically disappears on its own.) More serious side effects, including potentially fatal inflammation of the liver, seizures, or other signs of toxicity have been reported in rare cases. Most of the medications used for behavior problems in pets were designed for use in people. Few have been directly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in animals, although such use is not prohibited. This means that there may be limited information available on safety, toxicity, and effectiveness in dogs or other animals.  Because this is a relatively new area of veterinary medicine, demonstration of effectiveness through research has not been done in many cases. Veterinarians often must rely on case reports, their own clinical experience, and presentations at meetings to learn which medications and what dosage to recommend. Individual pets vary in their response to medication, just as people do. As a result, there will always be some element of trial and error in determining whether a particular medication will help solve a behavior problem.  If medication is used without behavior modification or environmental changes (and even when it is used with these techniques in some cases), the unwanted behavior may return once the medication is discontinued. Some problems may require treatment for a year or longer. In most cases medication is used for a period of several months.  Despite these limitations, medication has the potential to be very helpful in a\\xa0wide range of pet behavior problems, including fear-related problems like separation anxiety and thunderstorm phobias, compulsive behaviors like lick granulomas, and some types of aggression. Drugs and some supplements can help normalize your dog\\'s emotions and improve your ability to train anxious, overreactive, or fearful dogs. They can also improve a pet\\'s welfare. Your veterinarian can discuss whether medication might be appropriate for your dog.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/behavior-of-dogs/behavior-problems-in-dogs\\nname: Behavior Problems in Dogs\\ndocument: ## Behavior Problems Associated with\\xa0Aggression The most common behavior problems in dogs are those associated with aggression. Most cases involve a dog\\'s attempt to distance itself from the situation. There are many types of aggressive behaviors with different motivations, but fear, anxiety, uncertainty (conflict), inheritance (genetics), and previous learning are usually involved. Because of the risk of injury and the risk of worsening aggression, it is important to seek help from a veterinarian as soon as any signs of aggression occur. Early on, owners typically need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian.  Fear aggression occurs in situations that make a dog afraid. Fear causes most types of aggression. Fearful dogs may try to avoid the triggering threat but can become aggressive when they cannot escape (for example, when they are leashed, cornered, or being held), when they are motivated to stay (for example, proximity to a family member, property, or food), or learn that acting aggressively can remove the threat. Animals that learn that aggression \"works\" to eliminate threats may act aggressively even when they are not threatened. Poor socialization, temperament (inherited from parents), previous punishment, and learning can also lead to fear aggression.  Food-related aggression is shown around pet food, bones, rawhides, biscuits, or human food in dogs that are not starved or abused.  Idiopathic aggression has no known cause. It is unpredictable and unprovoked. This type of aggression is extremely rare.  Impulse control aggression, also called irritable or conflict aggression, is a threat or attack shown by dogs toward people under any circumstance that involves correction of the dog’s behavior by its owner. Diagnosis of this problem is difficult and cannot be based on a single event. Aggression toward family members is often mistakenly called dominance aggression. However, aggression toward family members is most commonly due to fear, possessive aggression, redirected behavior, or conflict (ie, the dog desires two opposite activities at once). Situations that often provoke aggression from the dog include physical restraint and control of food, toys, or resting places.  Inter-dog aggression is aggression that is directed at other dogs. The target can be another dog in the household or dogs that are encountered away from the home.  Maternal aggression is excessive aggression by a mother dog toward people, other dogs, or her puppies. A small amount of aggression may be normal, especially around the time of weaning. High levels of aggression may harm the puppies. The aggression should resolve after the puppies stop nursing. The behavior can also occur in females with \"false pregnancies\" and should resolve after hormone levels return to normal. This abnormal behavior may be inherited.  Pain aggression is a defensive reaction that occurs when a dog is in pain. It may happen when a dog anticipates being moved or touched. Organ dysfunction (kidney or liver), neurologic diseases, and hormonal disorders (of the adrenal, sex, or thyroid glands) can also lead to aggression. This is why veterinarians rule out medical causes of aggression.  Play aggression occurs along with play behaviors, such as play bows, chases, and charges. In contrast to previously held beliefs, energetic play by humans with dogs (for example, tug-of-war) does not necessarily produce play aggression.  Possessive aggression is constantly directed toward another individual that approaches or attempts to obtain a nonfood object or toy that the dog possesses.  Predatory aggression is behavior associated with predation (for example, stalking, hunting, and catching small animals). It is usually a quiet, sudden attack, and involves a fierce bite and shake of the prey animal.  Protective aggression is an attempt by a dog to guard its owner from an approach by another person, in the absence of a real threat from the other person. The aggression intensifies as the other person gets closer.  Redirected aggression occurs when a dog is prevented from reaching its intended target. The attack is then directed at another dog or person. The aggression is not accidental and the dog will actively pursue the second dog or person, particularly if they are directly associated with the interruption of the dog’s attack on its first target.  Territorial aggression is the protection of a place, such as a yard or a car, from the approach of another dog or person. It includes actions like chasing, growling, barking, or biting. The territorial dog reacts regardless of whether or not the individual approaching acts in any sort of threatening manner.  Other types of aggression can also occur in dogs. In rare cases, aggression can result\\xa0from infection, toxicity, or side effects from a medication.  ### Treatment Treatment of aggression in dogs is typically\\xa0complex and should ideally be designed by a specialist. Avoidance of situations that provoke aggression is always a good idea and can help reduce the risk of bites. Almost without exception, physical punishment, including the use of prong collars and electric shock collars can make an already aggressive dog worse. These techniques are not recommended, especially in the absence of professional supervision. ## Behavior Problems Associated with\\xa0Elimination Excitement urination is the release of a small amount of urine that occurs when a dog is active and excited, but not afraid.  Incomplete housetraining is consistent elimination in undesirable locations that is not associated with a lack of access or an illness. At 8 to 9 weeks of age dogs start to develop a habit of eliminating in certain places, so early attention to housetraining is important.  Marking behavior is urination or defecation that is used to send a social signal. For example, male dogs often lift a leg to urinate small amounts on fences, trees, or other objects. This can be an attempt to claim the area as their territory or just a way of letting other dogs know they’ve been there recently. Some dogs will mark when they visit new households, usually to \"cover up\" the odors of other animals. Usually, dogs will partially or fully lift their legs when they mark. It is most common in unneutered males, but females (both spayed and unneutered) and neutered dogs can also mark.  Submissive urination occurs in an otherwise housetrained dog only when the dog is showing postures associated with submission (for example, head lowered, ears back). The dog does not show any signs of fear or aggression.  ### Treatment There are two main aspects of housetraining: 1) encouraging a preference for a specific surface (for example, dirt or grass) or location, and 2) encouraging inhibition of urination or defecation until the appropriate location is accessible. The first age at which a dog is able to voluntarily inhibit elimination is at 8½ weeks of age. Appropriate housetraining for dogs involves exposure to the preferred surface for elimination starting at that age, absence of physical punishment, emphasis on positive reinforcement, frequent trips to the desired area, continuous supervision to avoid indoor accidents, quickly and completely cleaning up any accidents, and startling the dog to interrupt it only when the dog is caught in the act of eliminating in an inappropriate place. Punishment is not helpful and may be counterproductive. Dogs with submissive urination should never be startled. These are already anxious, uncertain dogs, and any punishment will worsen the behavior.  Taking dogs outside 15 to 30 minutes after eating and immediately after play, awakening, or if they slow down, can help speed housetraining. Housetraining an older dog is more a matter of fine-tuning the dog’s behavior and encouraging it to select a more appropriate surface or location. The presence of an older dog may help when housetraining a puppy, because the puppy can follow the lead of the older dog. Prevention is important and owners should know that puppies obtained from pet stores are usually much more difficult to housetrain than those obtained from other sources. Puppies in a pet store are generally not taken out of their cages often and do not have to inhibit elimination. They also may have learned to play with or eat feces.  Dogs with medical conditions can urinate and defecate inappropriately. A veterinarian can rule out any underlying medical conditions. ## Other Canine Behavior Problems Some common behavior problems of dogs are identified below. Many can be treated with behavior modification programs that focus on desensitization and counterconditioning ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). This is very important in the early treatment of fears, phobias, and anxieties. Your veterinarian might also prescribe medication to help your pet.  Abnormal ingestive behavior is eating unusual amounts or types of food or nonfood items. This includes pica (eating nonfood items), eating feces (coprophagia), drinking too much water, scavenging (seeking out food in the garbage or off countertops), anorexia (eating too little), overeating, and gorging (eating too fast). These behaviors can be a component of abnormal behaviors (such as compulsive disorders) or due to normal investigative and exploratory behaviors.  Attention-seeking behavior occurs when the dog acts in a way that gets the attention of people who are doing something not directly involving the dog. An example of this would be a puppy that barks to get attention when it is not being actively played with. The owner then reacts to the dog’s bark by giving it attention; both positive (playing with the dog) and negative (yelling at the dog) attention from the owner reinforces this behavior. This may be an undesirable behavior, but it is common and it is certainly a behavior that people unconsciously reinforce in their pets.  Senility, which is also called cognitive dysfunction, is similar in some ways to Alzheimer’s disease in people. Signs include a decrease in social interaction, loss of housetraining, disorientation (getting lost in familiar surroundings), and changes in sleep patterns. Physical and mental stimulation can slow down the signs of senility. Medication and a special diet are also available for treatment. These can delay the progression of signs, but will not reverse them.  Compulsive disorders are repetitive behaviors that occur out of their normal circumstances, or much more often or for much longer periods than is normal (for example, incessant licking). The dog spends so much time doing the compulsive behavior that it does not have time for normal activities. Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors that have no obvious purpose or function.  False pregnancy is a condition during which a dog acts as though it is pregnant, but is not. The dog may make a nest and may gather small objects that it protects as if they were puppies.  Destructive behaviors include chewing, stealing, getting into the trash, and digging. They are normal exploratory behaviors seen in unsupervised dogs that aren\\'t busy doing desirable activities. Exercise, reward-based training, and social enrichment can help when owners are home. When unsupervised, dogs should be confined away from areas they can destroy and given appropriate toys or chews.  Fear is a normal response to a real or perceived threat. Anxiety is a response to fear or apprehension when an animal anticipates a threat. Fear and anxiety have signs that overlap. Some nonspecific signs, such as avoidance, shaking, and trembling, can be characteristic of both fear and anxiety. Phobia is an exaggerated fear response that is sudden and profound and results in panic.  Hyperactivity is an extremely high level of activity that does not respond to correction, redirection, or restraint. True hyperactivity is rare in dogs and is different from overactivity. Overactive dogs are highly energetic and active, but are able to calm down and respond to human control.  Neophobia(fear of new things) is active avoidance, escape, or anxiety directed at unfamiliar objects and situations.  Noise phobia consists of a sudden and profound response to noise that leads to intense anxiety, panic, or attempts to escape confinement. The most common form is fear of thunderstorms, although fear of fireworks or other loud noises is also common.  Separation anxiety is a syndrome in which a dog panics when it is left alone. It causes intense anxiety and may lead the dog to bark, pace, or eliminate inside the house. Dogs that are confined commonly destroy kennels, walls, or doors in an attempt to reunite with their owners. Signs are often most severe within the first 15 to 30 minutes of the dog being left alone.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/selecting-and-providing-a-home-for-a-dog/selecting-a-dog\\nname: Selecting a Dog\\ndocument: Choosing the dog that is right for you and your family is very important. The large variety of breeds means that dogs come in all sizes, shapes, and colors, and have a range of temperaments. Many dog breeds have been developed for specific purposes and behaviors. A mismatch can result in unnecessary stress and lead to behavioral problems, which can be difficult to correct.  ## Size, Activity, and Temperament Size, activity level, temperament, and breed characteristics (including hair coat) should be considered in choosing a dog. Your dog will live with you for many years, so you must consider how these factors will best fit your lifestyle and situation. For example, large dogs (such as retrievers) and very active dogs (Jack Russell Terriers, for example) need room to run and play. These active dogs do better when they have access to a fenced yard for regular exercise and may not be the best choice for a city dweller who lives in a small apartment. Some dogs, such as Border Collies, appear to have a need to work (for example, herd), or they often become bored and out of sorts. Keep in mind that size is not always a good indicator of activity level. Many small dogs require significant amounts of exercise and attention, while some large breeds (Newfoundlands are a good example) can be relatively inactive when mature. Dogs with high activity levels may not be a good choice for someone whose mobility is limited. Smaller, active dogs (such as small poodles or terriers) may not be able to tolerate the rough play of young children.  One critically important consideration is whether the dog will be good with children or infants. Some breeds are generally better with children than others, but most dogs that are raised with children see them as just another family member. In these situations, the dog should be trained to respond properly to all members of the family. Adult dogs that are accustomed to a household without children may resent the attention given to a new child, resulting in behavioral problems such as aggression or soiling in the house. In any event, the early interactions when children are introduced into a household with dogs, and vice versa, should be closely monitored. Children or infants should never be left unsupervised with a dog. ## Climate When choosing a dog, it makes sense to consider regional climate. Heavy-coated breeds will have difficulty staying cool in hot southern climates, while thin, short-haired breeds may have problems in extremely cold winter temperatures. Small dogs that stay inside most of the time can generally get along fine in any region, provided their trips outdoors in potentially dangerous weather conditions are kept short. ## Age Selecting either a puppy or an adult dog has advantages and disadvantages. Puppies raised with your family usually integrate well into your environment, and a strong bond usually forms naturally. However, the adult size and activity level of a mixed-breed puppy can be difficult to predict. All puppies have a lot\\xa0of energy and require a great deal of attention and supervision, especially during the early, housetraining period. Puppies also require a greater initial investment in veterinary care ( see Puppy Care). On the other hand, adult dogs may have some initial difficulty adapting to your family or lifestyle and many need additional time and attention to adjust to their new environment. If you are able to obtain a medical and behavioral history from the previous owner or a shelter, this can be invaluable in assessing whether a particular dog is right for you. ## Finding the Right Dog Dogs can be obtained from a variety of sources ( see Potential Sources for Obtaining a Pet Dog). Again, there are advantages and disadvantages associated with each. For example, many pet shops obtain puppies from reputable kennels and shelters, while others purchase them from factory-like “puppy mills,” which raise dogs of questionable quality often under extremely poor conditions. If you want a purebred dog, you should search for registered breeders in your area. Shelters are often a good source of mixed-breed puppies, and purebred dogs are also often available. Regardless of the source, your best approach to selecting a pet is to research the source, ask questions, and carefully observe both the dog and its environment.  ### Ask Questions Checking out the source of your dog before you acquire it is important. If the source is a friend, neighbor, or ad in the paper, ask to see the dog’s parents (if possible). Ask about the health history, including any illness, vaccinations, heartworm preventive, and whether the dog has been spayed or neutered. Ask for and check references for breeders and pet shops. Ask why an animal is up for adoption and if it has any known medical or behavioral problems. If you are getting a purebred dog, ask if the parents have been tested for, and found free of, diseases common to the breed. ### Watch Closely Keep your eyes open when visiting the kennel, pet shop, or shelter. It is worthwhile visiting before you are ready to make your selection so that you can check things over without the distraction of falling in love with a new pet. Is the facility clean and well organized? Do the dogs look happy, or scared and timid? Do the dogs look healthy, or thin and sickly? Is the temperature of the building comfortable, with fresh water available to all animals? Many problems can also be “sniffed out.” Foul odors or dank, humid air suggest a building that is dirty or poorly ventilated. A clean kennel should smell slightly of disinfectant, not strongly of urine or feces. The puppies themselves should not smell of urine or feces.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/behavior-of-dogs/normal-social-behavior-in-dogs\\nname: Normal Social Behavior in Dogs\\ndocument: Dogs are highly social animals and are well adapted to living in groups. Studies have also shown that they are very good at interpreting human gestures and behavior. Dogs interact with each other and people through body postures, facial expressions, tail and ear positions, raising of hair or \"hackles,\" vocalizations, and scents. Although dogs evolved from the grey wolf 12,000-14,000 years ago, domestication and breeding practices have created variations in appearance, temperament, and social signaling. These variations can make it difficult for dogs and people to communicate with different breeds. Early and frequent socialization with many different dogs can help improve a dog\\'s ability to interact with other dogs and people.  Between 3 to 8 weeks of age, dogs tend to focus on other dogs (if available) for social interaction, and between 5 to 12 weeks of age they shift their focus to people. Dogs are most receptive to learning how to deal with new situations until about 16 to 20 weeks of age. After this age, dogs do not stop learning from exposure; they just do so at a much slower rate and perhaps in a different way. It is not critical to change the focus of exposure at one specific period, because given adequate opportunities, puppies will learn about the social and physical environments when they are ready. Dogs that are kept exclusively kenneled or not exposed to\\xa0people by 14 weeks of age may have severely undeveloped social skills. The best age to adopt a puppy is at about 8 weeks of\\xa0age. Unless there is no other choice, puppies should not be adopted until at least 7½ weeks of age.  Sexual maturity in domestic dogs occurs between 6 to 9 months of age (later for giant breeds), while social maturity develops at 12 to 36 months of age. In free-ranging groups, dogs that challenge the established social hierarchy may leave and form their own groups if they do not succeed in gaining a high rank. This situation may be similar to one form of inter-dog aggression that occurs in multiple-dog households ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Social maturity is also the time when problems with aggression and anxiety develop. Roaming, mounting, urine marking, and fighting are stimulated by sex hormones, particularly testosterone. These problems are often greatly reduced in males by neutering.  Most domestic dogs, except for Basenjis, have 2 heat (estrous) cycles per year. All members of the group may assist in puppy care. In multiple-dog groups, the highest-ranking dogs may be the only ones to breed.  Although the dog\\'s social structure has been referred to as \"pack hierarchy,\" it is not an accurate description of dogs\\' relationship with each other or with people. Hierarchy in dogs is not set in a straight line. Instead, it flows based on what resource the animals desire. It is maintained primarily by lower-ranking dogs giving way to higher-ranking ones and not, as commonly believed, by fighting. In addition, it only applies to a dog\\'s relationship to other dogs, not to its interaction with people.  ## Counseling to Prevent Undesirable Behavior Your veterinarian and their staff can work with breeders, trainers, pet stores, and shelters to ensure that newly adopted dogs get off to the right start. For puppies, this includes advice on socialization, normal dog behavior (eg, jumping up, play biting, elimination) and how it can be managed, a household environment that provides appealing but safe outlets for all of the dog’s behavioral needs (eg, chewing, social play, object play, rest), advice on dog communication, and learning principles of reward-based training. The goal should be to reinforce desirable behaviors and to ignore or prevent unwanted behaviors. Clicker training can be particularly useful to immediately mark and reward desirable behavior and gradually teach behaviors that more closely approximate the final desired outcome (for example, relaxation). Chewing and biting are common problems, because puppies need to explore and play and use their mouths to explore their world. Therefore, providing constructive social activities that do not include mouthing or biting people, such as tug games, retrieving, walking and running, chasing, hide and seek, playing with other dogs, and training for rewards, gives the puppy something positive on which to focus. A head halter is also an option for better control of the head and muzzle. Another way to manage chewing and biting is to provide chew toys, food-stuffed toys, and food-dispensing toys. When the puppy cannot be effectively supervised, the household should be set up to ensure success (and avoid failure). Preventing undesirable behaviors while providing the dog with options acceptable to the owners and the dog gives the dog control to make choices, reduces uncertainty and anxiety, and prevents undesirable behaviors. Of particular value to establish a safe haven is a crate, exercise pen, or room to provide security and safety for the dog when it cannot be supervised or wants to be alone. A daily routine can be established that provides stability and predictability for the dog, beginning with meeting the dog\\'s social and physical needs, followed by sessions of inattention during which the dog is given the opportunity to nap and rest or to engage in exploratory play with its food and chew toys. By confining the dog to a crate, pen, or room during these “inattention” times, the dog learns to spend time on its own; this also may prevent damage to property, housesoiling, and even separation anxiety. Undesirable behavior might alternatively be prevented through environmental management (eg, child gate, shutting doors, tie downs, deterrent devices). Neutering males may also help to prevent\\xa0testosterone-influenced behaviors such as urine marking, mounting, and roaming.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/normal-social-behavior-and-behavioral-problems-of-domestic-animals/behavioral-problems-of-cats\\nname: Behavioral Problems of Cats\\ndocument: As with dogs, undesirable behavior might be 1) normal behavior but undesirable for the owners (eg, climbing, scratching, and excessive nocturnal activity); 2) behaviors that fall within the range of normal but are at or near the limits, excessive in intensity or frequency, and particularly challenging or disturbing for the home environment (eg, play biting, petting-induced aggression, overexuberant play, play/predation, vocalization, asocial, litter box avoidance); or 3) behaviors that are abnormal, pathologic, or incompatible with living in the home (eg, intercat aggression, fear and avoidance, urine marking). In most cases of normal but undesirable behaviors, the owners require guidance and resource material on meeting the behavioral needs of cats and understanding learning principles to reinforce what is desirable while preventing what is undesirable. When behaviors are at or near the limits of normal, a more in-depth behavior assessment is needed to discuss realistic goals for what might be achieved, how the environment might be managed, and how the behavior might be modified. In some households, it may be impractical to make the changes necessary to achieve an endpoint that meets the owner’s needs. In cases when the behavior is abnormal or incompatible with the home environment, a behavior consultation is required to diagnose, determine the prognosis, implement behavior and environmental modifications, and dispense drugs or supplements when indicated to achieve a sufficient level of improvement for the owner and the cat. The most common behaviors seen by veterinary behaviorists are elimination (undesirable toileting and marking) and aggression. Because aggressive encounters in cats may be overt or subtle and passive, their frequency may be seriously underestimated.  For both prevention and treatment, it is important to first ensure that the behavioral needs of the cat are adequately met. This is a particularly important consideration for cats housed exclusively or primarily indoors. Although individual variability in expression can be extensive, a cat\\'s primary behavioral needs include eating (hunting), drinking, elimination, security, play and exploration, climbing, perching, and scratching. Specifically, hunting and feeding needs might be better addressed by giving food in small portions throughout the day and placing food or treats inside toys that require some manipulation to release the food (batting, chasing, rolling, pawing). To add an element of hunting, the cat can be given opportunities to chase, pounce on, and bite toys the owner dangles or\\xa0pulls in front of the cat.  Play appears to be motivated by two mechanisms: an initial interest if the toy possesses appropriate characteristics (texture, small size) and rapid habituation. Owners should find a number of toys that interest the cat and play with several different toys until the cat’s interest wanes. Cats may also be offered small toys for batting and chasing; boxes or containers to explore; appealing outlets to climb, perch, and scratch; and perhaps an occasional catnip toy (to which 50%–75% of cats respond).  Teaching the basics of reinforcement-based training allows owners to focus on rewarding desirable behaviors (eg, where to eliminate, climb, scratch, or perch). Clicker training ( see Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals) can be particularly useful to immediately time (mark) desirable behaviors and gradually shape outcomes that more closely approximate the final goal. Punishment should be avoided, because it can cause fear and anxiety toward the owners or fear of handling and petting and, at best, will stop the undesirable behavior only when the owner is present. Provided all of the cat’s needs are adequately met, the best approach to stop repetition of the undesirable behavior can be to prevent access to areas where problems might arise. Another alternative is to teach the cat to avoid the area by making it unpleasant with taste (eg, cayenne pepper), odor (eg, citrus), substrate (eg, upside-down carpet runner, double-sided sticky tape), or perhaps a motion-activated device (eg, alarm, air spray).  ## Diagnosis and Treatment Assuming all possible medical causes have been excluded, a thorough history is necessary to diagnose, determine the prognosis, and develop an appropriate treatment program. In cats, especially those with elimination and marking problems, it is particularly important to assess the environment either by visiting the home or having the owners diagram the home so that it can be determined how the environment affects the problem and how it might be modified to improve the situation.  Response substitution (training an alternative desirable behavior) can be a useful approach if the cat is reward trained with food or favored toys to respond to one or more simple commands (eg, come, sit). A leash and harness can be used as an aid in training as well as a way to prevent undesirable behaviors and ensure safety. For fearful behavior, access to the stimuli should be prevented, at least in the short term. For example, if cats are fearful or aggressive with other cats or visitors, confinement away from the stimulus is an essential first step to ensure safety as well as to prevent further aggravation of the problem. This generally involves housing the cat in its own room with litter, toys, bedding, and food. When the cat is calm and comfortable, it might then be possible to gradually reintroduce the cat using favored toys, treats, or food for counterconditioning.  Drugs for fearful behaviors that could be used on an ongoing basis include fluoxetine, paroxetine, or clomipramine; buspirone or other tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) might be an alternative. A benzodiazepine such as alprazolam might be used on an as-needed basis for situational anxiety such as car rides. Because of the range of individual variability in behavioral effects and adverse effects, trials with different benzodiazepines should be done in advance to determine which drug and dose achieves the desired effect and for how long. Caution is necessary, particularly with the use of diazepam, for any indication of anorexia or depression, because rare cases of acute and potentially fatal hepatic dysfunction have been reported. In some situations, a benzodiazepine such as clonazepam might be considered on an ongoing basis for a more immediate anxiety reduction and to enhance appetite for counterconditioning. Natural products including the F3 cheek gland pheromone (Feliway® [available as diffuser or spray], l-theanine (Anxitane®), alpha-casozepine (Zylkene®), and a diet containing both alpha-casozepine and l-tryptophan (Royal Canin Calm Feline™) might also be used alone or adjunctively with drugs or other natural products to help calm, reduce anxiety, or reduce the stress associated with environmental change. The F4 cheek gland pheromone (Felifriend®), associated with social marking (bunting) of cats, is also available as a topical gel in some countries to reduce fear of people or other cats. With intercat aggression, buspirone or a benzodiazepine might increase the confidence of the victim cat during reintroductions. However, anxiolytic drugs could disinhibit and increase aggression. ## Housesoiling With housesoiling, the first step is always to exclude medical problems, because any condition that affects urine volume, frequency, control, or ability to access the litter box can contribute to soiling. Evaluating the behavioral history is then the primary process to make the diagnosis, determine the prognosis, and develop a treatment plan. Important aspects of the history include whether the elimination is urine or feces, whether urine deposits are vertical (spraying) or horizontal (soiling), duration and frequency of the problem, signalment and temperament of the soiling cat, when and where the cat eliminates, litter box details (number, placement, cleaning, substrate, size), the cat’s daily routine, and its home environment.  ### Urine Marking (Spraying): Spraying is emission of a stream of urine onto vertical surfaces, usually accompanied by elevation and quivering of the tail and in some cases treading of the feet. Marking on horizontal surfaces (eg, owner’s clothing, bedding, or countertops) is less common. Spraying is much more commonly seen in male cats, and neutering will reduce or eliminate it in most cats, although ~10% of neutered males continue to mark. Marking may be due to anxiety, such as might arise with introduction of a new cat; a change in schedule, environment, or family (eg, renovations, new furnishings, new baby, marriage or divorce); or unfamiliar visual, auditory, or olfactory stimuli.  Treatment can include a combination of prevention, environmental modification, behavior modification, and medication. Providing more litter boxes and more litter box locations, cleaning the soiled areas with bacterial or enzymatic cleaners, and cleaning the litter box more frequently may reduce or eliminate marking in some cats. Punishment is contraindicated, because it increases fear and anxiety in an already anxious animal. Unless the stimuli inciting marking or the underlying factors contributing to the marking can be effectively resolved, most cats are likely to require drug therapy with either fluoxetine or clomipramine (buspirone or other SSRIs or TCAs might be an alternative). Feline pheromones in the form of a spray on marked locations or a diffuser in the environment might also effectively reduce marking alone or in combination with drugs. ### Inappropriate Elimination: Soiling on horizontal surfaces with urine, feces, or both, can be a problem in males and females. Cats that consistently return to the same location or substrate may have a location or substrate preference. Cats that do not use their litter for urine, feces, or both may be avoiding the litter itself, the litter box, or its location. A common cause of avoidance is any medical problem that might cause painful elimination, increased frequency, lack of control, or difficulty accessing the litter box. If medical problems have been excluded or treated and the problem persists, the focus should then be on the behavioral history. Avoidance might arise because of aspects of the substrate (texture, depth, scent, cleanliness), box (size, shape, hood), or location that reduce appeal; unpleasant experiences at or near the box (eg, insufficient cleaning, noises, pain due to medical problems); or difficulty in gaining access to the box. Although anxiety may not be an inciting factor for inappropriate elimination, cats may avoid the litter or box if fearful (ie, personality) or when there is conflict between cats in the home (whether active or passive). Although substrate, litter box, and location preferences may arise secondary to avoidance, some cats may actually have a preference for a particular odor, texture, or location.  Treatment should focus on providing a litter, box, and site that is most appealing to the cat; reducing or preventing the use of the soiled location; and resolving the underlying factors contributing to the soiling. Appeal might be improved by identifying and resolving potential deterrents (eg, undesirable location, fear-evoking stimuli such as furnace noise, or limited access such as a shared washroom), adding additional boxes or additional sites, finding a more appealing location for the litter, improving access to the litter (eg, larger box, ease of entry, ease of exit), and finding out which litter (eg, sand, clumping, clay, soft towel, scented) and box type (eg, size, shape, height, covered, self-cleaning) is preferred by offering the cat choices to decide. Access to the soiled location might be prevented by blocking access to the area, or the appeal reduced by using odor counteractants in the soiled area, making the area unpleasant (eg, double-sided sticky tape, upside-down [nubs-up] carpet runner), or changing the function of the area (play, scratching, feeding, sleeping). ## Aggression ### Aggression Toward People: Aggression toward owners may be fear induced or related to play or predation. Cats that bite during petting may have a low tolerance for physical contact, and some cats bite to keep people from approaching or handling them when they are resting, sleeping, or eating (which may be a learned, fear, or social issue). Aggression may be particularly intense if the cat is approached when it is aroused. When the arousal is due to a stimulus to which the cat cannot gain access (eg, another cat outside, loud noise), the cat may redirect its aggression to any person who approaches.  Some cats display abnormal and out-of-context social responses, including aggression, when approached or handled. This may have a genetic component that is compounded by insufficient socialization, lack of adequate maternal care, inadequate early handling, and fear-evoking or traumatic early experiences. However, at the time of presentation, most aggression also has a learned component, because any unpleasant response on the part of the owner (eg, fear, punishment) will cause increased fear, whereas retreat of the owner negatively reinforces the behavior. Aggression toward strangers most often has a fear component. ### Aggression Toward Other Cats: Cats may display aggression toward other cats due to play, predatory behavior, redirected behavior, fear, and perhaps as a status-related behavior in which cats use aggression to retain control of sleeping areas, common areas, or possessions. Ultimately, the relationship that develops between any pair of cats will be affected by learning, because fearful responses by either cat can increase aggression, as will retreat of one of the cats (negative reinforcement). Aggression toward unfamiliar cats is most often a fear response but may have a territorial component. ### Treatment: The first step is to ensure that further injuries are prevented. Avoidance (physical, visual, and preferably olfactory separation of cats that are fighting) is paramount, and early intervention is best. Although some cats will need to be separated at all times until they are calm enough to be reintroduced, if there are particular times or situations when conflicts arise, it might be necessary to separate the cats only at these times. Only after the cats are calm (which can take days to months) can desensitization and counterconditioning with favored rewards begin (ie, play with toys, treats). Desensitization and counterconditioning might first begin with odors by grooming each cat with a brush or towel used on the other, and by feeding each cat separately in a common area on opposite sides of a partition (glass, screen, or solid door) and then in a common area at sufficient distance that the cats can be calm and take food or play with toys. Training one or both cats to wear a leash and harness can help to ensure safety and distance during reintroductions, while a bell on the aggressor can help the victim be aware of its whereabouts. Providing more three-dimensional space, including climbs and perches, and ensuring sufficient resources at sufficient distance to facilitate avoidance can further decrease conflict. Reward training limited to a few selected verbal cues (eg, come, sit, go to your room) can further aid in managing the cats during introductions or in diffusing potentially aggressive situations. Punishment should be avoided, because it increases fear and anxiety in cats. Drugs might also be indicated ( see Treatment of Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, and Aggression). ## Feline Compulsive Disorders Abnormal repetitive behaviors in cats are derived from normal behaviors such as stalking, chasing, grooming, etc. These may be exacerbated by stress or anxiety such as alterations in relationships with people or other cats, or may be inadvertently aggravated by the owners either reinforcing or punishing the behavior (increasing conflict and anxiety). If these behaviors occur out of context or in a frequency or duration in excess of that needed to accomplish the task, a diagnosis of compulsive disorder should be considered. Medical problems must be excluded, because they can be responsible for many of the same signs. For example, self-mutilation, excessive grooming, and/or self-directed aggression can be due to any condition that might cause neuropathic pain or pruritus such as adverse food reactions, atopic dermatitis, and parasitic hypersensitivity.  Cats that suck, lick, chew, or even ingest non-nutritive substances—including natural materials such as wool or cotton, synthetic fabrics, plastic, rubber, paper, cardboard, and string—may have a compulsive disorder if the problem becomes sufficiently frequent or intense; however, disease processes, in particular those that might affect the GI tract, should first be excluded. Oriental breeds develop pica, particularly sucking of woolen objects, more frequently than other cats. Hallucinatory and locomotory compulsive disorders are less common than in dogs; however, painful conditions and any disease process affecting the neurologic system first need to be excluded.  Cats often improve with modifications to the environment that provide more control and predictability and increased enrichment, combined with medications that augment the amount of brain serotonin such as fluoxetine and clomipramine. ## Hyperesthesia Hyperesthesia may not be a specific disorder but rather a sign of underlying medical or behavioral problems. Most commonly, the skin along the lumbosacral area may twitch or ripple. There may be excessive self-grooming, hissing or biting at the back or flank, and intensive tail wagging. Some cats cry, dash away, and even defecate. These episodes arise when the cat is highly aroused and may be incited by physical contact or external stimuli. A compulsive disorder is a consideration when the intensity, frequency, and duration of these problems is sufficiently severe. However, medical causes such as neuropathic pain, dermatologic conditions, myopathies, and focal seizures can also present with similar signs. Therefore, a therapeutic response trial for neuropathic pain, seizures, pruritus, or compulsive disorders might be part of the diagnostic process. ## Fear Fear may arise in cats as a result of genetic factors, lack of sufficient early socialization and exposure, or fear-evoking experiences. The fear may be of unfamiliar people, unfamiliar cats, dogs, noises, or places and situations such as car rides, veterinary visits, and unfamiliar environments. Some cats may also be fearful of familiar people and cats. This may be evidenced as threatening displays and overt aggression (see above) or\\xa0avoidance, withdrawal and hiding, and possibly spraying.  Treatment should begin with identification and avoidance of any situation, stimulus, approach, or handling that might lead to fear. When the cat is sufficiently calm, gradual improvement might be achieved with desensitization and counterconditioning. Drugs might also be indicated ( see Treatment:). ## Aging and Cognitive Dysfunction Aging and younger cats have similar behavior problems; however, the likelihood of a pathophysiologic underlying condition is higher in older cats. Many diseases, including those affecting the CNS, metabolic and endocrine systems (eg, renal disorders, hyperthyroidism), sensory decline, and pain (eg, arthritis), may present with behavioral signs. Once medical problems have been excluded or treated, behavioral therapy may be required. Behavior problems in senior pets may be more difficult to resolve because of a decline in cognitive function, medical problems that cannot be entirely resolved, and drug contraindications or adverse effects.  Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is less commonly reported in cats than in dogs. Yet in one study, ~35% of cats >11 yr old displayed at least one sign of CDS, and 50% of cats >15 yr old showed two or more signs. Brain changes are similar to those seen in CDS in dogs ( see Aging and Cognitive Dysfunction). Environmental enrichment and mental stimulation is paramount to prevent and treat CDS. Medications, diets, and supplements might also improve the signs of CDS or slow its progression. Although no drugs or diets are licensed for feline CDS, selegiline and propentofylline have been used off-label. Both S-adenosyl methione and a commercial diet containing antioxidants, arginine, B vitamins, and fish oil have demonstrated improvement in learning and memory in geriatric cats. Cognitive supplements containing antioxidants, vitamins, and phosphatidylserine have also been developed for cats.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavioral-medicine-introduction/treatment-of-behavior-problems-in-animals\\nname: Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals\\ndocument: With production animals, treatment focuses on group management, environmental or housing modifications, and, in some cases, moving individual animals out of their groups or into other groups.  With companion animals, treatment of behavior problems varies with diagnosis and prognosis. In general, the behavior treatment plan recommendations encompass 3 categories:  ## Management of Behavior Problems in Animals Keys to managing behavior problems in animals include meeting the pet\\'s behavioral needs, avoiding stimuli that incite undesirable behavior, and preventing rehearsal of undesirable behavior.  Meeting the animal\\'s needs can improve behavior and welfare, especially if the inability to express normal behavior is a contributing motivation to performing the undesirable behavior. Needs vary between species, and the motivation to meet those needs varies between individuals.  Initially, prevention is necessary to avoid further compromising the pet’s welfare and to ensure safety of the pet, owner, and any target of the problem behavior. Repetition of the behavior further aggravates the problem by triggering unwanted emotional states, rehearsing undesirable behavior, and teaching the animal to repeat or intensify the undesirable behavior in the future.  Each exposure in which the outcome is unpleasant can condition further fear and anxiety. Therefore, improvement is generally a slow and gradual process, and owners must have realistic expectations of what can be achieved.  To prevent repetition, either the stimuli that incites the problem behavior can be kept away from the pet or the pet can be kept away from the stimuli. Environmental modifications (eg, distance, visual barriers, auditory barriers, physical barriers) may be required to achieve this. ## Modification of Behavior Problems in Animals Modifying the pet’s behavior is accomplished by applying the principles of learning and behavior modification, primarily achieving and rewarding desirable outcomes along with using products that improve safety, decrease fear and anxiety, or help to achieve the desired response more effectively (eg, muzzles, head halters, no-pull harnesses, etc).  The most commonly used behavioral techniques include habituation, extinction, counterconditioning and desensitization, response substitution, and shaping.  Flooding is often talked about but seldom used because the practice is often inhumane and is likely to make most animals\\' behaviors worse.  Although punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people correctly use this technique. In addition, there are both humane and safety issues with the use of positive punishment.  Most of the humane, passive, or positive techniques involved in behavior modification in pets focus on cultivating a positive conditioned emotional response and developing the pet\\'s coping skills through reinforcement of desirable behaviors in the presence of an inciting trigger. The longterm goal is not only to prevent undesirable behaviors but also to teach the pet a more desirable way to feel or respond when the inciting stimulus occurs. These techniques are not hard to learn and, together with preventive strategies, are often very successful. In fact, dogs trained with rewards have fewer behavior problems, less fear and anxiety, and less avoidance than dogs trained with punishment.  The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in the techniques of behavior modification and their associated implementation strategies.  ### Behavior Modification Principles ### Classical Conditioning The following terms are used in classical conditioning:  The pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus results in a conditioned stimulus and a conditioned response.  Classical conditioning can occur in both positive and negative ways. Examples of a conditioned emotional response include the following:  Problems arise when a fearful conditioned emotional response is established toward a previously neutral stimulus (visual, olfactory, auditory, animate, inanimate) by repeated pairing with a fear-producing stimulus. Once this occurs, the stimulus itself will elicit the fear response.  For example, when a pet is meeting new people (neutral stimulus) and lunges or barks, the use of positive punishment (unconditioned stimulus), such as choke collars, prong collars, shock, and pinning to inhibit the undesirable behavior, may condition a new fear-conditioned emotional response in which unfamiliar people now represent a fear-conditioned stimulus.  A visit to the veterinary clinic that begins as a neutral situation can quickly become fear evoking if it is associated with unpleasant outcomes or is amplified by owner anxiety. In addition, all of the stimuli (sights, sounds, smells) associated with the event also become conditioned stimuli for fear.  In much the same way, rain, wind, darkening skies, and lightning can quickly become conditioned, fear-evoking stimuli for pets fearful of thunder. ### Counterconditioning and Desensitization Counterconditioning involves the consistent and repeated pairing of a stimulus that evokes an unpleasant response with something that is emotionally positive (eg, a reward) until a positive emotional association is made. To be successful, counterconditioning should be coupled with desensitization. In desensitization, the stimulus is minimized or decreased (eg, by decreasing volume, increasing distance, changing the environment, or modifying the stimulus to something less threatening) to a level that does not evoke the fear response. Once a positive emotional association is made at the decreased level, rewards can be paired with stimuli of gradually increasing intensity.  Desensitization and counterconditioning are extremely time-consuming. The exercises must be constantly repeated so that the response is altered to a positive emotional one. All stimuli (sights, sounds, odors, tactile sensations) that evoke fear must be considered. Clients often want both quicker fixes and less work. However, moving too quickly provokes anxiety and sabotages any behavior modification program. ### Extinction The ending of a behavior once all reinforcement is removed is termed extinction. For example, if people pet a dog that jumps up on them for attention, the behavior continues; if they stop, the dog will eventually extinguish its response because the reward is no longer there.  However, any form of intermittent reinforcement—even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping—will prolong the performance of the response. Valuable rewards, a long history of performance, and intermittent reinforcement all increase resistance to extinction.  Owners also must be prepared for the intensity of the behavior to initially increase before it is extinguished; this is called an extinction burst. Giving in will make extinction even more difficult as the animal learns that higher-intensity behaviors achieve the desired outcome. ### Flooding Flooding is used to treat fears of harmless stimuli by forcing the animal to stay in the stimuli\\'s presence until the fear is extinguished. This procedure is seldom effective and has welfare implications in dogs because it initially enhances fear and cannot be stopped until all physiological and emotional signs of fear are gone. If done improperly, flooding can therefore increase problem behaviors (sensitization).  In practice, a controlled level of flooding, in which the stimulus is presented at a level low enough to cause mild fear and the pet is not removed until it habituates, is quite often used as a component of behavior modification. This process can then be combined with reinforcement—ie, the pet is given something rewarding (positive reinforcement), or the stimulus is removed (negative reinforcement), when the fear response subsides or abates. ### Habituation Habituation is the gradual lessening of a response to a stimulus. Usually this occurs with repeated presentation of a stimulus, whereby the animal learns that the stimulus does not signal anything important. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road might at first run away when traffic passes but eventually learn to ignore it.  Stimuli associated with potentially adverse consequences are more difficult to extinguish with habituation than other stimuli. In prey species, responses to sounds associated with predators would be difficult to habituate because the responses have been selected for and generally are adaptive.  If the fear response is too intense, the animal may become increasingly more fearful of the stimulus instead of habituating. This is termed sensitization.  If an extended interval has occurred since the time an animal last experienced a stimulus to which it had habituated, the animal may again react when reexposed to the stimulus. This is termed spontaneous recovery. ### Operant Conditioning Operant conditioning is a method based on making an association between a behavior and the consequences of that behavior. The results either increase or decrease the likelihood of future responses. There are 4 types of behavior-consequence relations: positive and negative punishment and positive and negative reinforcement. \"Negative\" refers to the removal of a stimulus, and \"positive\" refers to the application of a stimulus. Reinforcement increases the likelihood a behavior will be repeated, and punishment leads to a decrease in behavior.  Positive reinforcement occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is applied (generally something pleasant or appealing), so the behavior is increased in the future. In positive reinforcement training, a reward should be given immediately and consistently following the behavior until the\\xa0behavior is reliably repeated. If the behavior is to be trained on command or cue, a signal (eg, word, hand sign) should then be added before the behavior-reward sequence.  Once learned, behavior can be reinforced on a variable schedule, so that the period of time or number of responses before the reward is given is varied. Rewards are used for positive reinforcement; however, a reward is not synonymous with positive reinforcement. Unless there is a clear relationship (timing, consistency, contiguity) between the behavior and the reward, the reward does not achieve the goal of positively reinforcing behavior.  Negative reinforcement occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is removed (generally something unpleasant) and the behavior is increased in the future. Negative reinforcement must not be confused with punishment because punishment decreases behaviors, and reinforcement increases behaviors.  One example of negative reinforcement is avoidance or escape behavior. For example, if an animal anticipates an unpleasant outcome (eg, meeting another dog, veterinary visit), then the aversive outcome will not occur if the animal retreats. Similarly, if the owner puts pressure on a head halter until the desired behavior (eg, sit, back up) is achieved, the release of tension is negative reinforcement. One potential consequence of negative reinforcement is that if a pet’s threats or aggression lead to removal of a stimulus (eg, dog, delivery person, owner), the behavior is reinforced by the retreat of the stimulus.  Positive punishment occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is applied (generally something unpleasant) and the behavior is decreased in the future. For positive punishment to be successful, the aversive stimulus (eg, startling with a loud noise, spraying compressed air) must occur sufficiently close to the onset of the behavior, with complete consistency and at an appropriate intensity, that the probability of the behavior\\'s occurring in the future is lessened.  In positive punishment, if behavior does not decrease after the first few applications, then the punishment is not being appropriately timed, or the behavior is too strongly motivated, to be deterred by punishment.  Positive punishment applied by a person (eg, owner, trainer) is intended to cause the pet to become fearful of repeating the behavior. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that positive punishment–based training and confrontational techniques are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression. A potential consequence is that the pet becomes fearful or defensive to the punisher or to an approaching hand. Relationships with people should always remain emotionally pleasant. Also, if an unpleasant consequence occurs only when the owner is present, the behavior may continue in the owner’s absence.  Another problem with positive punishment is that punishment paired with exposure to a stimulus (eg cars, other dogs, strangers) can result in a conditioned fear of the stimulus (see classical conditioning). In addition, some dog owners have been misled by inappropriate training advice that advocates confrontation, with the intent of asserting leadership (dominance). Often, punishment is more about the owner’s anger than about changing the pet\\'s behavior.  Punishment cannot be used to achieve desirable behaviors, only to stop what is undesirable. If the goal is to make the pet fearful of repeating an undesirable behavior (eg, garbage raiding, taking things from counters, chewing plants) or to keep the pet away from an area (room, couch, bed), then environmental or pet-activated punishment (eg, motion detector alarms or sprays, upside-down carpet runners, aversive tastes, double-sided tape, or bark-activated sprays) or remote punishment (eg, spraying water while out of sight, remote-activated alarm or spray) might be most appropriate. However, before focusing on how to stop what is undesirable, the owner should first focus on providing a desirable alternative to allow the pet to meet its behavioral needs (eg, where to sleep, where to climb, what to chew).  Negative punishment occurs when, as a consequence of the undesirable behavior, something is removed (generally something pleasant or appealing) and the behavior is decreased in the future. For example, if the pet is receiving affection or play when an undesirable behavior (eg, play biting, mouthing, mounting, jumping) begins, the consequence of immediate removal of the play or affection will \"negatively\" punish the undesirable behavior. However, unless the pet can determine what behavior leads to the removal of play or affection, the undesirable behavior may actually intensify because of frustration over not receiving its reward (see extinction). The owner should also focus on positively reinforcing a desirable alternative behavior to meet that pet\\'s behavioral needs (eg, play or affection when the animal is calm). ### Overlearning Overlearning is the repeated evocation and expression of an already learned response. It is a phenomenon frequently used in training for specific events but may be underused in preventing fearful responses in dogs. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, increases the resistance to extinction, and increases the probability that the response will become automatic, or the response of first choice, when circumstances are similar. ### Premack Principle The Premack principle is that when a more desirable behavior—from the animal\\'s perspective—is made contingent on a less desirable behavior, the less desirable behavior is more likely to be repeated. Thus, the more desirable behavior serves as the reinforcer. For example, if a pet wants to go out or cross the street for its walk, the owner can train a sit-stay before each of these behaviors. A horse or dog that wants to walk ahead can be taught that walking on a slack rein or leash will result in this behavior. ### First-Order Reinforcers A first-order reinforcer, more commonly known as a reward (or a primary reinforcer), is an event that is naturally reinforcing. A reward is anything desirable to the pet, from an activity such as petting, walking, or play to an item such as a toy, food, chew, or treat. ### Second-Order Reinforcers A second-order reinforcer, also called a conditioned reinforcer, is an event that is reinforcing because of its association with a first-order reinforcer. By being repeatedly and continuously paired with a primary reward such as a toy or treat, second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would, as long as the pairing is repeatedly maintained. Second-order reinforcers can be created as a signal that can be used at a distance to convey that a reward is coming. The following are examples of second-order reinforcers:  Clicker training is an excellent way to immediately “mark” desirable responses, gradually shape new or more desirable (eg, longer, more relaxed) behaviors, or associate a positive emotional response with the stimulus. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing; however, once mastery is achieved, the animal can be reinforced each time the desired behavior is observed. ### Response Substitution Response substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desirable one. For example, high-value rewards can be used to train desirable target behaviors that are alternatives to an undesirable behavior. However, if the undesirable behavior is part of the pet’s natural repertoire (eg, greeting, barking), alternative behaviors can be particularly difficult to train. Specific examples of response substitution include training a dog to sit or lie down as an alternative to jumping up, mounting, or play biting; or training to sit, walk on loose leash, or back up, rather than forging ahead or running out the door.  Training should begin in a variety of environments where success can be most readily achieved. If the desired endpoint for the new response is for the animal to be quiet and calm, the owner must learn to read the pet\\'s body posture, facial expressions, and breathing to be able to gradually shape the desired behavior. Training can then move to environments with increasing distractions and locations where the undesirable behavior is most likely to occur. Alternatively, the pet might be enticed to engage in a behavior that is incompatible with the undesirable behavior (eg, teaching the dog to fetch a toy when visitors arrive instead of jumping up).  To replace the undesirable behavior with one that is desirable, response substitution can be coupled with desensitization by beginning training with stimuli of low enough intensity while training the target behaviors (eg, relaxation) with high-value rewards. However, for pets that are fearful or anxious, the focus should be on desensitization and counterconditioning to change the pet’s emotional state, rather than the behavioral response. ### Shaping Shaping works through gradual approximations of a desirable behavior and allows the animal to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For instance, when teaching a puppy to sit, providing a food reward for a slight squat will increase the probability that squatting will be repeated. Over time, squatting behavior is ultimately rewarded only when it more closely resembles a sit, and finally, when it becomes a true sit. Shaping can also be used to reward both progressive increases in duration and frequency of a more desirable behavior. ## Medication for Behavior Problems in Animals Psychotropic drugs and adjunctive treatments (eg, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products, pheromones, nutritional therapies) can be used to reestablish a more stable emotional state and to improve trainability in patients that are anxious, fearful, or overly reactive. Drugs might also be effective in the treatment of behavior that is abnormal or pathological. In addition, drugs may be indicated to improve compromised welfare.  Although drugs can improve the animal\\'s emotional state and facilitate new learning, only with concurrent behavior modification can new neuronal pathways be established, new behaviors learned, and fearful responses to stimuli changed to positive ones.  Before dispensing drugs, clinicians should rule out underlying medical problems that might be causing or contributing to behavioral signs or that might have an impact on drug selection and use.  To rule out underlying medical problems, veterinarians should perform a physical examination and collect a minimum database (CBC, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, and measurement of serum thyroxine concentration—plus in cats, testing for both feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus). Additional testing, such as blood pressure measurements, thoracic and abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, and thyroid panel, may also be indicated, depending on the patient, differential diagnoses, and medication considered.  Evidence-based decision-making is a way to provide the owner with the best treatment options. Treatment should be selected using the evidence combined with the clinician’s expertise regarding the specific animal, client, and problem.  Very few drugs have been adequately tested in rigorous randomized controlled trials for use in veterinary behavioral therapy. In fact, most drugs used in veterinary behavioral therapy are human drugs, very few of which have had pharmacokinetics established for animal species. Use of human drugs in animals can lead to inaccuracies regarding dosage, duration of effect, contraindications, and adverse effects. In addition, these drugs have a wide range of published dosages based on the application, individual variability, and desired outcome. Therefore, before dispensing any of these medications, practitioners prescribing drugs to modify behavior must remain current with veterinary behavior literature with respect to indications, recommended dosages, evidence of efficacy, potential adverse effects, and contraindications.  Depending on the drug and patient, compounding may be required to achieve an appropriate dosage and formulation for administration; however, reformulation may alter a drug’s pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and stability. Studies on the use of transdermal preparations of behavioral drugs such as fluoxetine, amitripyline, and buspirone have found little to no absorption transdermally.  Considerations for medication choice include the following:  Drugs are differentiated not only by their drug class but also by their indications as \"baseline\" daily medications, \"situational\" medications, or adjunctive therapies.  Baseline medications usually are used regularly (daily to multiple times daily). Some drugs in this category may take weeks to reach optimal therapeutic effect. Baseline medications tend to work best for chronic or unpredictable stimuli that may elicit the behavior problem. Some examples of drugs that fall in the baseline category include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.  Especially for patients with multiple behavior problems, a baseline medication can create a foundation for which a situational medication or adjunctive therapy could be synergistic or complementary:  Situational medications have a short onset to effect and a short duration of effect. Situational medications can either be used on a regular basis—usually in combination with a baseline medication—or as needed. Situational medications tend to work best for acute, predictable stimuli that may elicit an undesirable behavior. Examples of situational medications include alpha-2 agonists, benzodiazepines, trazodone, and gabapentin.  Adjunctive therapy, like baseline medication, involves regular (daily to multiple times daily) use.  A variety of adjunctive therapies (eg, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products, nutritional therapies, pheromones, therapy wraps) have been used to treat fear and anxiety.  In reported studies, the following have been found to have potential therapeutic effects to calm and decrease underlying fear and anxiety:  In reported studies, the following have been found to have potential therapeutic effects for cognitive decline: ## Key Points ## For More Information\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavioral-medicine-introduction/prognosis-of-behavior-problems-in-animals\\nname: Prognosis of Behavior Problems in Animals\\ndocument: If animals with behavioral disorders are to improve, client understanding and compliance are critical. The strategy to modify undesirable behavior requires the owner to be prepared and capable of identifying each situation that elicits the undesirable behavior, assessing risk, maintaining safety, and substituting a more desirable behavioral response. Therefore, avoiding or preventing the provocative situation, especially initially, is important.  Important prognostic and risk considerations to review with the owner include the following:  In addition, special consideration will need to be given in cases of aggression to evaluate risk and ensure safety. For guidelines on risk factor assessment, see the European Society of Veterinary Clinical Ethology (ESVCE) website.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/description-and-physical-characteristics-of-dogs/description-and-physical-characteristics-of-dogs\\nname: Description and Physical Characteristics of Dogs\\ndocument: Also see professional content regarding management of dogs.  Although dogs look very different from people, they share many of our body’s characteristics. They have a heart and circulatory system to transport blood, lungs to take in oxygen and rid the body of\\xa0carbon dioxide, a digestive tract to absorb nutrients from food, and so on. However, it is the differences between dogs and people that are most interesting and that give dogs their unique characteristics as family members.  ## Body Size Dogs come in many shapes and sizes. The smallest breeds include the toy and miniature varieties, such as the Toy Poodle, Papillon, Chihuahua, and Shih Tzu. These dogs usually weigh only 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kilograms), or even less. Medium-sized dogs include many of the terriers and spaniels, which weigh in the 10 to 50 pound (4.5 to 23 kilograms) range. Larger still are the retrievers, shepherds, and setters, which often weigh 65 to 100 pounds (30 to 45 kilograms). Finally, the giant breeds, such as the Mastiff, Komondor, and Saint Bernard, can approach or exceed 200 pounds (91 kilograms). Of course, sizes vary within breeds, with males usually being larger than females. Mixed-breed dogs include all size ranges. ## Metabolism Dogs have a higher metabolism than people. They breathe faster, pump blood faster, mature faster, and have a higher normal body temperature ( see Table: Normal Canine Physiologic Values). Young dogs seem to have even more energy than children. However, this high metabolism comes with a shorter life span. A common rule of thumb is that 1 dog year equals about 10 to 12 people years for the first 2 years, and then 4 people years (per dog year) after that ( see Table: Dog Years versus People Years). Actual life span depends on health and size, with small breeds generally living longer than larger ones.  ### Temperature Regulation Dogs are generally much better at conserving heat than at cooling themselves. In sled dogs, who can survive outdoors even in bitterly cold temperatures, the fur acts as an insulating “blanket” that retains the heat generated by the dog’s high metabolism. However, in hot or humid weather, most dogs have difficulty. Dogs cannot sweat, which is an effective form of evaporative cooling. Instead, dogs lose heat primarily by panting. These rapid breaths (10 times faster than normal) are an attempt to lose heat through evaporation by moving hot, moisture-filled air in and out. During the short, shallow breaths in panting, little air can be exchanged in the lungs. In fact, dogs must stop panting periodically to take a good respiratory breath. Drinking water also helps dogs cool down, and the canine hair coat helps insulate from the sun.  Because the cooling system of dogs is relatively poor, certain summer situations can be dangerous and even life threatening. Sadly, many dogs die of heat stroke every year ( see What to Do at the Scene and How to Transport). The most common problem is associated with being shut in a parked car. Even with the windows rolled down, the inside of a parked car can quickly reach 150°F (66°C) or more in the summer, which can cause heat stroke and death in a matter of minutes. Other dangerous situations involve being penned or tied out in the sun (without access to shade) or being locked in a poorly ventilated travel crate.  Ways to keep dogs cool during hot weather include air conditioning, spray misters, shade, dips in a wading pool, or gentle spraying with a garden hose. Keeping dogs wet during the heat of the day provides a method of evaporative cooling. Plenty of cool, fresh drinking water should be available at all times. ## The Senses Dogs have the same 5 senses that people do but to very different degrees. Some senses are less developed than in people, with others being extraordinarily more sensitive.  ### Sight Dogs can see movement and light much better than people. In the retina of the eye, dogs have more of a specific type of cell called a rod, which is good at collecting dim light, so they have better night vision. A reflective layer in the dog’s eye, called the tapetum lucidum, magnifies incoming light. This reflective layer lends a characteristic blue or greenish glint to dogs’ eyes when light (for example, headlights of passing cars) shines into them at night. However, dogs do not have as much visual acuity as people, meaning that they cannot distinguish fine details as well. They also cannot differentiate colors as well because they have fewer of the cells in the retina called cones, which are responsible for color vision. Contrary to popular belief, however, dogs are not completely colorblind.  A unique feature of the dog eye is the nictitating membrane, which is also called the third eyelid. This additional eyelid is a whitish pink color, and it is found under the other eyelids in the inside corner (near the nose) of the eye. The third eyelid extends up when needed to protect the eyeball from scratches (for example, while traveling through brush) or in response to inflammation. ### Hearing The ear canal of the dog is much deeper than that of people and creates a better funnel to carry sound to the ear drum. The average dog can hear about 4 times better than the average person, including sounds at higher frequencies than can be detected by the human ear. Dogs are also better at distinguishing the direction of a sound, which is an adaptation useful for hunting. Unfortunately, this deeper ear canal predisposes dogs to ear problems. Grease, wax, and moisture can build up in the ear, leading to inflammation and infection. Floppy ears or hair within the ears further limit ventilation, making matters worse. This is why many dogs need frequent preventive ear cleaning. ### Smell and Taste Dogs have an extraordinarily acute sense of smell; it is about a million times more sensitive than that of people. They can detect odors at extremely low levels and can distinguish odors that are subtly different. This is why dogs are able to sniff out drugs and explosives at airports, search for human victims at disaster sites (including victims deep under water), and follow the scent track of criminals.  Odor molecules dissolve in the moisture that coats the inside of the canine nose. Signals are then sent from the olfactory membranes in the nose to the olfactory center of the brain, which is 40 times bigger in dogs than in people.  Dogs also have an organ on the roof of the mouth that allows them to “taste” certain smells. As in people, taste and smell in dogs are closely linked. However, dogs gain much more information about food from smell than from taste. Dogs have only about one sixth the number of taste buds that people do, and their distinct sense of taste is actually quite poor. ## Locomotion Dogs have most of the same muscles, tendons, joints, and ligaments as people. All 4 of the dog’s limbs are maximized for locomotion, from a steady walk to a rapid sprint. In many respects, dogs run like horses, and have the same 4 gaits: walk, trot, canter, and gallop. The canine bones that are comparable to the long bones of our hands and feet are located in the dog’s lower legs. The angular hock in the hind legs is comparable to the ankle in people. Most dogs can swim, although some breeds specifically developed for swimming (for example, retrievers) can swim better than others (such as Bulldogs).  ### Pads and Nails The canine paw contains specialized structures that help the dog move over different surfaces. The bottom of the paw is covered by thick, resilient pads that become callused after years of steady wear in direct contact with the ground. These pads protect the paw and help provide a secure grip on many types of surfaces. The toenails help provide traction while running and are also used for digging. Canine toenails are thick, brittle structures made up of a protein called keratin (just like hair). A large blood supply runs down the middle and feeds the cuticle (or “quick”) of\\xa0the growing nail. Avoiding these blood vessels when trimming toenails can be difficult, especially when the nails are dark. Regardless, keeping nails trimmed is important because nails that snag or break during running or jumping can cause considerable bleeding and pain. Broken nails should be examined by a veterinarian, who can trim away the fractured part of the nail, treat the wound to stop any bleeding, and prevent infection. Dogs have rudimentary equivalents of human thumbs called dew claws that are found on the middle side of the front paws or lower front legs. Dew claws have no function, but they commonly snag and break. Dew claws should also be trimmed periodically to prevent snagging and to keep them from curling around and growing into the foot. They are commonly removed in very young puppies or as an additional surgical procedure when dogs are spayed or neutered. ## Skin and Hair Canine skin has several layers, including an outer epidermis that is constantly being replaced and an inner dermis that contains nerves and blood vessels. Canine skin is thinner and much more sensitive than human skin. Dogs should be bathed only with shampoos made specifically for pets. Shampoos and other topical products for people can be irritating to canine skin and should be avoided.  Canine fur grows from hair follicles in the skin. Dogs have compound hair follicles, with a central (guard) hair surrounded by 3 to 15 secondary hairs growing out of the same pore. Sebaceous (oil) glands within the skin lubricate the hair, keeping the coat shiny and water resistant. Hair growth is controlled by several factors, including nutrition, hormones, and time of year. In general, dogs shed at a slow steady rate all year round, with periods of increased shedding in the spring and fall. Shedding replaces hair gradually, without bald patches (which can be a sign of illness and should be investigated).  The main functions of the hair coat are to protect the skin and to help regulate temperature. Fur traps air, which provides a layer of insulation against the cold. Small muscles attached to the guard hairs allow dogs to raise these hairs, which improves air trapping. Dogs also raise their hackles as a threatening gesture in response to danger.  Different breeds of dogs have different types of hair coats. Breeds from northern climates (such as Huskies and Malamutes) have a soft, downy undercoat that provides better insulation in cold weather. Water breeds (retrievers, for example) have more long and stiff guard hairs to protect the skin and undercoat from harsh environmental conditions. Water breeds also have ample oil secretions to lubricate the hair. Breeds from warmer climates have shorter coats designed only to shade the skin. Poodles have very fine, curly hair that sheds far less than that of other breeds. ## Teeth and Mouth Like their wolf ancestors, dogs are carnivores with teeth designed for rending and tearing meat. They have 28 deciduous (baby) teeth that are replaced by 42\\xa0permanent (adult) teeth between 2 and\\xa07 months of age ( see Table: Canine Adult Dentition). The different\\xa0types of teeth have specialized functions, depending on their position in\\xa0the mouth. The front teeth, which include the 12 incisors and 4 large canine\\xa0teeth (eye teeth), are designed for grasping and tearing. The rearward premolar and molar teeth grind food into smaller pieces that can be swallowed.  The mouth also contains the salivary glands, which secrete saliva that lubricates the food and begins digestion. The tongue helps guide food to the back of the throat and is important for licking up small food pieces and lapping up water. Dogs also lick as a sign of affection or subservience, or both. ## Digestive and Urinary Tracts The gastrointestinal tract includes the stomach, the small intestine, and the large intestine (colon). This system digests food into useful nutrients, absorbs water, and eliminates waste. Digestive problems often show up as vomiting or diarrhea, which can have many causes, including viral infections; worms; stress; or ingestion of bones, sticks, or other foreign material.  The urinary system eliminates nitrogenous wastes from protein breakdown and helps control fluid levels. Waste products are filtered by the kidneys and then sent through the ureters to the urinary bladder for storage. Urine is passed out of the body through the urethra. In males, the urethra doubles as a channel for sperm during copulation. Urinary infections are much more common in females and usually show up as frequent dribbles of urine that may be tinged with blood.  Both urinary and digestive problems are often associated with straining while urinating or defecating. At first glance, it may be difficult for dog owners to tell the source of the problem. Therefore, it is important to watch your dog while it eliminates and to note the character and color of the urine and feces. Your veterinarian may request a sample of the urine or feces, or both. Diarrhea usually consists of frequent, soft or runny feces that may be a different color (often yellow, gray, or black) than usual. Any sign of blood in the feces calls for veterinary attention. Repeated, unproductive attempts to pass a bowel movement can be a sign of serious constipation or bowel obstruction, which can be an emergency. Prompt veterinary attention is needed if the dog has a tense, painful abdomen or is passing only small amounts of bloody, gel-like feces.  ### Anal Glands Rump rubbing or “scooting” is usually associated with impacted anal glands, although it can be confused with a digestive problem. The anal glands are located in a layer of muscle at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions around the anus. These scent glands contain a foul-smelling secretion that is normally expressed during a bowel movement. The secretions often thicken, which can plug the duct, causing pressure and irritation that can lead to infection. Many dogs need to have their anal glands manually emptied by their veterinarian on a regular schedule. ## For More Information Also see professional content regarding management of dogs.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/behavior-of-dogs/diagnosing-behavior-problems-in-dogs\\nname: Diagnosing Behavior Problems in Dogs\\ndocument: Many “health” problems faced by pet dogs are associated with behavior problems or unmet expectations about the pet’s behavior. Your veterinarian will first need to rule out any possible health problems that could be causing your pet\\'s behavior to change. For example, a medical condition could be causing your pet to urinate in the house. Your veterinarian will take a behavioral history before making any diagnosis. A behavioral history generally includes the following: 1) the sex, breed, and age of the dog; 2) the age at onset of the condition; 3) the duration of the condition; 4) a description of the actual behavior; 5)\\xa0the frequency of the problem behavior (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly); 6) the duration of a typical episode (seconds, minutes, hours); 7) any change in pattern, frequency, intensity, and duration of episodes; 8) any corrective measures tried and the response; 9) any activities that stopped the behavior (for example, the dog falls asleep); 10) the 24-hour schedule of the dog and owner, as well as any day-to-day changes; 11) the dog’s family history (in other words, are there signs of similar problems in the dog’s parents or littermates?); 12) the dog\\'s environment and housing; and 13) anything else the owner thinks is relevant.  You and your veterinarian should consider the \"ABCs\" of the behavior problem. What happens prior to the behavior (the Antecedent)? What is the Behavior? What happens immediately afterward (the Consequences)? Because behaviors can change as dogs learn and mature, your veterinarian will also consider how the problem initially started.  Modern veterinary care includes routine screening questions about specific behavior complaints—such as inappropriate or undesirable chewing, growling, or odd behavior—in addition to routine questions that alert your veterinarian to potential medical problems. This routine screening helps establish what is normal for your dog. If your veterinarian does not ask about behavior problems, be sure to mention them yourself. Unfortunately, many owners do not report behavior problems to their veterinarians, and these problems are a major reason pets are given away or put to sleep.  Because behavioral diagnoses cannot be made on the basis of a one-time event, pet owners can complete a questionnaire at each visit to mark the patterns of the dog’s behavior. Your veterinarian can then identify whether the signs (barking, growling, lunging) create a pattern that meets specific diagnostic criteria such as fear aggression or protective aggression ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Both you and your veterinarian must use the same definitions for the same nonspecific signs. You both must also accurately recognize and describe behaviors that are of concern.  Video of your dog’s behavior can help ensure that your veterinarian makes an accurate diagnosis. The questionnaire relies on your description and, because of this, is more subjective. However, when combined with video, your veterinarian can use questionnaires to diagnose behavior problems. When you recognize the behaviors leading to or associated with the problematic ones, you can avoid or prevent the situation that leads up to the problem. By viewing the problematic behavior on video, your veterinarian can work with you to help treat the condition.  ## Defining the Problem The following is a brief glossary of terms commonly used when discussing behavior.  An abnormal behavior is one that is dysfunctional and unusual. This is different from a behavioral complaint, which can be a normal but undesirable action (such as jumping up, getting into the garbage, or herding).  Abnormal repetitive behaviors occur when dogs do not adjust to a situation in an appropriate way, often responding with repetitive or fixed movements or actions. Abnormal repetitive behaviors include both compulsive/impulsive and stereotypic behaviors (see below). Examples include signs pertaining to the mouth (eating non-food objects, licking, gulping, and excessive eating), brain (repeated jaw snapping, light chasing), movement (spinning, pouncing), or self-directed injuries (hair plucking, excessive skin licking).  Aggression in animals is everything related to a threat or attack. There are various kinds of aggressive behavior in animals, such as territorial defense, predatory aggression, and inter-male aggression ( see Behavior Problems Associated with Aggression in Dogs). Examples of aggressive acts include biting, growling, and scratching.  Anxiety is the anticipation of danger accompanied by signs of tension (vigilance, increased movement, and tense muscles). The focus of anxiety can be internal or external.  Compulsive or obsessive-compulsive disorders are abnormal and repetitive behaviors typically done in an attempt to achieve a goal. These intense behaviors may be difficult to interrupt or be uncontrollable. They can start from normal behaviors (such as grooming or eating) and normal situations (frustration or conflict) but then progress to inappropriate situations and intensities. Some compulsive behaviors appear to be genetic, such as tail chasing in German Shepherds or flank skin sucking in Doberman Pinschers.  A dog in conflict has tendencies to perform more than one type of activity at once. For example, a dog may want to approach a person to get a treat, but may also be afraid of the person and unwilling to come too close. The motivation for the conflict, except for extreme instances associated with survival functions (for example, eating), is very hard to identify in animals. Conflict might result in aggression or displacement behaviors (see below).  Displacement activity is the resolution of a conflict by performing a seemingly unrelated activity. Because the animal is physically or behaviorally unable to act appropriately, it will often perform an apparently irrelevant activity. Examples of these irrelevant activities are grooming, feeding, scratching, and sleeping. It is less specific than redirected behavior, which is directed toward another target.  Dominance refers to competition over a\\xa0limited resource (for example, a treat, a\\xa0favorite toy, or a comfortable resting place). A higher-ranking animal can displace a lower-ranking one from the resource. Rank or hierarchy is usually defined by an ability to control the resource. A dominant animal is not the one engaged in the most fighting. Most high-ranking animals can be identified by the submissive behavior exhibited toward them by others in their group. Dominance terminology applies to communication between members of a single species (dog-to-dog) but does not apply to communication between species (human-to-dog).  Fear is a feeling of apprehension associated with the presence of an object, individual, or social situation and is part of normal behavior. Deciding whether a fear is abnormal depends on the context. For example, fire is a useful tool, and fear of being burned by it is normal. However, if the house were not on fire, such a fear would be irrational. If this fear was constant or recurrent, it would probably be considered an abnormal behavior. Normal and abnormal fears usually vary in intensity. The intensity increases as the real or imagined nearness of the object that causes the fear increases.  Frustration arises when a dog is unable to complete a behavior due to physical or psychological obstacles. When pets are frustrated, they can respond with redirected behavior, a displacement activity, or anxiety. For example, a dog that is frustrated by being unable to get to a cat on the other side of a fence can respond by attacking another household pet. This term, like dominance, is overused and usually undefined, which means it often is not very helpful when diagnosing a behavior problem.  Most fearful reactions are learned and can be unlearned with gradual exposure. Phobias, though, are profound, fearful reactions that do not diminish either with gradual exposure to the object or without exposure over time. A phobia involves sudden, all-or-nothing, profound, abnormal reactions resulting in panic. Phobias may develop quickly or over time, but once established they are characterized by immediate and intense anxiety. Fear may develop more gradually and, within an episode of fearful behavior, there may be more variation in intensity than would be seen in a phobic reaction. Once a phobic event has been experienced, any event associated with it or the memory of it is enough to generate the reaction. Even without re-exposure, such as the use of a shock collar on a dog, phobias can remain at or exceed their former high level for years. Phobic situations are either avoided at all costs or, if unavoidable, are endured with intense anxiety or distress. There also appears to be a genetic or hereditary basis for these responses in some canine breeds.  Redirected behavior is directed away from the inciting target and toward another, less appropriate target.  Stereotypic behaviors are repetitious, relatively unvaried actions that have no obvious purpose or function. They are usually derived from normal behavior, such as grooming, eating, or walking. These behaviors are abnormal because they interfere with the normal functioning of the animal.  Vacuum activity can occur when an animal cannot perform a highly desired instinctive behavior. Examples include flank sucking and excessive licking. Vacuum activities have no useful purpose. ## Treatment of Behavior Problems in Dogs The diagnosis, treatment, and expected outcome of a behavior problem vary depending on the underlying issue. Early on, owners will usually need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian. Treatment for abnormal behaviors takes time and commitment from pet owners. Quick fixes or \"magic pills\" do not exist for behavior problems. In addition, the safety of household members, other pets, and the pet itself must be considered, especially in the cases of aggression. Modifying a pet\\'s behavior involves behavior modification techniques to promote and reward desirable behaviors; the use of products that improve safety, reduce anxiety, or quicken improvements (for example, muzzles or no-pull head halters); and, possibly, drugs and supplements.\\n\\n'},\n",

A behavior modification technique called flooding, described below, is not used very often because it is more likely to make animals worse. While it is claimed that punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people use punishment correctly. For punishment (such as screaming at the dog) to be successful, it\\xa0must occur at the beginning of the behavior, be consistently delivered, and be strong enough to stop the unwanted behavior. Most punishments are not given at the right time or are not the appropriate type for the situation. \"Dominance\" training techniques that encourage owners to assert leadership through physical confrontations are also not recommended. Multiple studies have shown that training based on punishments or confrontations are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression. Dogs trained with rewards have fewer behavioral problems and are less fearful.  ## Behavior Modification Techniques Most of the techniques involved in behavior modification are not hard to learn and can be successfully used as preventive techniques. They do require a regular investment of time and effort, however. The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in these techniques.  Habituation is a simple form of learning that involves no rewards. It is merely the ending of or decrease in a response to a situation that results from repeated or prolonged exposure to that situation. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road may at first run away when traffic passes, but eventually learn to ignore it. A dog that habituates to one type of sound does not, as a consequence of this habituation, automatically become habituated to other sounds. Habituation is not the same as failing to respond to stimulation as a result of fatigue, sensory adaptation, or injury. The effects of habituation are generally long lasting. However, if an animal is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful stimulus (such as a predator) without being harmed, habituation does not generally occur. Because of this, scientists believe that responses to dangerous stimuli may have an inherited resistance to habituation. If the fearful response is too intense, the dog may become more fearful instead of adjusting to the stimulus.  Spontaneous recovery is associated with habituation. If there is a long period of time between when a dog has experienced an event to which it had habituated and re-exposure to the same event, the dog may again react. For example, a puppy barks to get a reaction. The more the owner attempts to quiet it, the more the puppy barks. It will continue this pattern because it is getting the attention it wanted. Even if the attention is “negative,” some puppies will find it rewarding. The best method to discourage the behavior is to ignore it. Eventually the puppy stops barking if the owner consistently ignores it. However, the bad behavior comes back every now and then. This is called spontaneous recovery.  Conditioning refers to associations between stimuli and behavior. For example, a hungry dog drools (the behavior) when it sees food (the stimulus). After this, every time that the hungry dog sees the food a bell is rung (a second stimulus). Once the food and bell have been paired several times, the dog will drool even if it just hears the bell. This is called conditioning. The bell generates the same response as the sight of food. After several times, the dog has learned to associate the bell with the food. Conditioning can be positive or negative. For example, the sound of a doorbell can cause fear or excitement in a dog, depending on whether the dog likes or dislikes visitors.  Reinforcement is any event that increases the chances that a certain behavior will be repeated. Reinforcements can be positive or negative. When positive reinforcement (a reward) is used in training, there is a positive relationship between the behavior and its consequences. The more the pet does a behavior, the more it gets positive reinforcement. This makes that behavior increase. A negative reinforcement (which\\xa0is mistakenly thought of as punishment by many people) is something unpleasant that increases a behavior when it is removed. For example, being held tightly may be unpleasant to a squirming puppy. But the hold is released only when the puppy calms down. After several times, the release from restraint will increase the chance that the puppy will relax faster.  Second-order reinforcers are signals that can be used at a distance to let the dog know that a reward is coming. Commonly used second-order reinforcers are words, such as “good girl,” hand signals, and clickers. By carefully pairing these with a primary reward (such as food or petting), second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would. For example, a clicker can be associated with patting on the head as a reward for sitting and staying. By associating the clicker with a reward, you can train the dog to sit and stay from farther away and still reward the behavior by using the clicker. Positive training and clicker training have become very popular. However, it is possible to do an excellent job at positive training without using any second-order reinforcers. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing. In some situations involving problem behaviors, the incorrect use of a clicker may hinder, rather than help, a behavior\\xa0modification program.  Extinction is a response that stops when a reward is removed. A classic example of extinction involves a dog that jumps up on people for attention. If people pet the dog, the behavior continues. If they stop petting the dog, the dog will eventually stop jumping up because the reward is no longer there. However, even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping will reinforce the pattern. The more valuable the original reward, the longer it has been present, and the more uncertainty there is about whether the reward has been truly removed, the greater the resistance to extinction. Resistance to extinction can also occur even without reinforcement if the reward was good enough and was tightly linked to the behavior.  Because there is often an association between getting the reward and the intensity of the behavior, the intensity or frequency of the behavior you are trying to eliminate usually increases at the beginning of extinction. In other words, a behavior you are trying to extinguish may get worse before it gets better. It is critical that you do not give in. Giving in will only make extinction more difficult. The dog will learn that, although your threshold has increased, the dog can override it by working harder.  Overlearning is the repeated performance of an already learned behavior. It is frequently used in training for specific events, and may also be useful for preventing fearful responses in dogs. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, it increases the resistance to extinction, and it increases the chance that the behavior will become an automatic or “knee-jerk” response in similar situations. This aspect can be extremely useful in teaching a dog to overcome a fear or anxiety.  Shaping is a learning technique that works well for dogs that do not know what response is desired by the trainer. Shaping works through gradual approximations and allows the dog to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For example, when teaching a puppy to sit, giving the puppy a food treat for squatting will increase the chance that squatting will be repeated. This squatting behavior is then rewarded only when it becomes more exaggerated, and finally, when it becomes a true sit.  Desensitization is a way to gradually teach a dog to tolerate a situation by carefully exposing it to that situation in small steps. If a puppy gets overexcited at the sound of the doorbell, a tape recording of the doorbell could help stop the undesirable behavior. If the tape is played very softly at first and then only gradually increased in volume as long as the puppy remains calm, then the puppy may stop reacting to the doorbell.  Counterconditioning is a method for reducing unwanted behavior by teaching the dog to replace it with another more favorable behavior. In the doorbell example above, the puppy will learn faster if it is first taught to sit, stay, and then relax in exchange for a treat. The puppy must be absolutely quiet and calm, and convey by its eyes, body posture, and facial expressions that it would do anything for its owner. Once this behavior is learned, the desensitization is added by playing the tape recording at a gradually increasing volume. If at any time the puppy starts to get too excited, the tape recording should be lowered in volume until the puppy relaxes. Relaxing is the key and is the first step to changing the behavior. Counterconditioning and desensitization can take a lot of time and effort. The exercises must be frequently repeated so that the unwanted behavior decreases until it is no longer a problem.  Flooding is prolonged exposure to a stimulus until the dog eventually stops reacting. This is the opposite of the approach taken in desensitization. It is far more stressful than any of the other treatment strategies and if not used correctly will make things worse. The most common problem is increased fear. This technique should be used only by a professional and only as a last resort.  Punishment is also known as aversive conditioning. It is any unpleasant event that lowers the chance that a behavior will be repeated. Punishment can be positive or negative. Positive punishment refers to applying something unpleasant to decrease a behavior, whereas negative punishment refers to removing something positive to decrease a behavior. Punishment is not the same as negative reinforcement ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). To be most successful, punishment must occur as early as possible (within a few seconds of the start of the behavior), and it must be consistent and appropriate. Critical factors in punishment include timing, consistency, appropriate intensity, and the presence of a reward after the undesirable behavior ends. This is the most frequently ignored part of treatment for people whose pets have behavior problems. Owners often resort to physical punishment as the first choice, but punishment does not need to be physical. Furthermore, punishment is just as hard to use correctly as counterconditioning and desensitization. Punishment is never an “easy out” and has a high chance of failure. It can also lead to other negative consequences, such as increasing the chance of fear or aggression.  The Premack Principle states that more likely behaviors will reinforce less likely behaviors. When misbehaving increases the likelihood that a dog achieves a goal, the more likely the dog is to misbehave. To prevent the misbehavior, the owner can teach the dog an alternative, positive behavior; for example, teaching a dog to sit and stay before allowing it outside may deter bolting.  Response substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desired one. An example is teaching a dog to lay down instead of jumping up. Owners should begin in a calm environment where success is likely, then progress to places with more distractions as the behavior is learned. Dogs may first need to be desensitized to the stimuli for response substitution to be successful. ## Use of Medication to Treat Behavior Problems Your veterinarian may prescribe medication to help treat a behavior problem of your pet. Drug treatment for almost any behavior change is most useful when combined with behavior modification.  In recent years there has been an increase in the use of medication to treat a variety of behavior problems in pets ( see Table: Drugs Used to Treat Behavior Problems in Dogs). There are a number of potential disadvantages to the use of medication for treating these problems, however, and you should know that there is no “magic bullet” that will easily and quickly solve the problem. The limitations of medication use include the potential for adverse effects, cost, the need to treat for a considerable length of time before the medication takes effect, limited information on what medication is most effective, and the potential that the problem will reappear once the medication is withdrawn.  All medications have the potential to cause side effects. Fortunately, most of the modern antianxiety and antidepressant medications used in pets are well tolerated. Gastrointestinal upsets (leading to reduced appetite, vomiting, or diarrhea) are the most common side effects seen. In some pets, decreased activity or lethargy may occur in the first week or so of treatment as the animal adjusts to the medication. (This reaction typically disappears on its own.) More serious side effects, including potentially fatal inflammation of the liver, seizures, or other signs of toxicity have been reported in rare cases. Most of the medications used for behavior problems in pets were designed for use in people. Few have been directly approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in animals, although such use is not prohibited. This means that there may be limited information available on safety, toxicity, and effectiveness in dogs or other animals.  Because this is a relatively new area of veterinary medicine, demonstration of effectiveness through research has not been done in many cases. Veterinarians often must rely on case reports, their own clinical experience, and presentations at meetings to learn which medications and what dosage to recommend. Individual pets vary in their response to medication, just as people do. As a result, there will always be some element of trial and error in determining whether a particular medication will help solve a behavior problem.  If medication is used without behavior modification or environmental changes (and even when it is used with these techniques in some cases), the unwanted behavior may return once the medication is discontinued. Some problems may require treatment for a year or longer. In most cases medication is used for a period of several months.  Despite these limitations, medication has the potential to be very helpful in a\\xa0wide range of pet behavior problems, including fear-related problems like separation anxiety and thunderstorm phobias, compulsive behaviors like lick granulomas, and some types of aggression. Drugs and some supplements can help normalize your dog\\'s emotions and improve your ability to train anxious, overreactive, or fearful dogs. They can also improve a pet\\'s welfare. Your veterinarian can discuss whether medication might be appropriate for your dog.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/dog-owners/behavior-of-dogs/behavior-problems-in-dogs\\nname: Behavior Problems in Dogs\\ndocument: ## Behavior Problems Associated with\\xa0Aggression The most common behavior problems in dogs are those associated with aggression. Most cases involve a dog\\'s attempt to distance itself from the situation. There are many types of aggressive behaviors with different motivations, but fear, anxiety, uncertainty (conflict), inheritance (genetics), and previous learning are usually involved. Because of the risk of injury and the risk of worsening aggression, it is important to seek help from a veterinarian as soon as any signs of aggression occur. Early on, owners typically need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian.  Fear aggression occurs in situations that make a dog afraid. Fear causes most types of aggression. Fearful dogs may try to avoid the triggering threat but can become aggressive when they cannot escape (for example, when they are leashed, cornered, or being held), when they are motivated to stay (for example, proximity to a family member, property, or food), or learn that acting aggressively can remove the threat. Animals that learn that aggression \"works\" to eliminate threats may act aggressively even when they are not threatened. Poor socialization, temperament (inherited from parents), previous punishment, and learning can also lead to fear aggression.  Food-related aggression is shown around pet food, bones, rawhides, biscuits, or human food in dogs that are not starved or abused.  Idiopathic aggression has no known cause. It is unpredictable and unprovoked. This type of aggression is extremely rare.  Impulse control aggression, also called irritable or conflict aggression, is a threat or attack shown by dogs toward people under any circumstance that involves correction of the dog’s behavior by its owner. Diagnosis of this problem is difficult and cannot be based on a single event. Aggression toward family members is often mistakenly called dominance aggression. However, aggression toward family members is most commonly due to fear, possessive aggression, redirected behavior, or conflict (ie, the dog desires two opposite activities at once). Situations that often provoke aggression from the dog include physical restraint and control of food, toys, or resting places.  Inter-dog aggression is aggression that is directed at other dogs. The target can be another dog in the household or dogs that are encountered away from the home.  Maternal aggression is excessive aggression by a mother dog toward people, other dogs, or her puppies. A small amount of aggression may be normal, especially around the time of weaning. High levels of aggression may harm the puppies. The aggression should resolve after the puppies stop nursing. The behavior can also occur in females with \"false pregnancies\" and should resolve after hormone levels return to normal. This abnormal behavior may be inherited.  Pain aggression is a defensive reaction that occurs when a dog is in pain. It may happen when a dog anticipates being moved or touched. Organ dysfunction (kidney or liver), neurologic diseases, and hormonal disorders (of the adrenal, sex, or thyroid glands) can also lead to aggression. This is why veterinarians rule out medical causes of aggression.  Play aggression occurs along with play behaviors, such as play bows, chases, and charges. In contrast to previously held beliefs, energetic play by humans with dogs (for example, tug-of-war) does not necessarily produce play aggression.  Possessive aggression is constantly directed toward another individual that approaches or attempts to obtain a nonfood object or toy that the dog possesses.  Predatory aggression is behavior associated with predation (for example, stalking, hunting, and catching small animals). It is usually a quiet, sudden attack, and involves a fierce bite and shake of the prey animal.  Protective aggression is an attempt by a dog to guard its owner from an approach by another person, in the absence of a real threat from the other person. The aggression intensifies as the other person gets closer.  Redirected aggression occurs when a dog is prevented from reaching its intended target. The attack is then directed at another dog or person. The aggression is not accidental and the dog will actively pursue the second dog or person, particularly if they are directly associated with the interruption of the dog’s attack on its first target.  Territorial aggression is the protection of a place, such as a yard or a car, from the approach of another dog or person. It includes actions like chasing, growling, barking, or biting. The territorial dog reacts regardless of whether or not the individual approaching acts in any sort of threatening manner.  Other types of aggression can also occur in dogs. In rare cases, aggression can result\\xa0from infection, toxicity, or side effects from a medication.  ### Treatment Treatment of aggression in dogs is typically\\xa0complex and should ideally be designed by a specialist. Avoidance of situations that provoke aggression is always a good idea and can help reduce the risk of bites. Almost without exception, physical punishment, including the use of prong collars and electric shock collars can make an already aggressive dog worse. These techniques are not recommended, especially in the absence of professional supervision. ## Behavior Problems Associated with\\xa0Elimination Excitement urination is the release of a small amount of urine that occurs when a dog is active and excited, but not afraid.  Incomplete housetraining is consistent elimination in undesirable locations that is not associated with a lack of access or an illness. At 8 to 9 weeks of age dogs start to develop a habit of eliminating in certain places, so early attention to housetraining is important.  Marking behavior is urination or defecation that is used to send a social signal. For example, male dogs often lift a leg to urinate small amounts on fences, trees, or other objects. This can be an attempt to claim the area as their territory or just a way of letting other dogs know they’ve been there recently. Some dogs will mark when they visit new households, usually to \"cover up\" the odors of other animals. Usually, dogs will partially or fully lift their legs when they mark. It is most common in unneutered males, but females (both spayed and unneutered) and neutered dogs can also mark.  Submissive urination occurs in an otherwise housetrained dog only when the dog is showing postures associated with submission (for example, head lowered, ears back). The dog does not show any signs of fear or aggression.  ### Treatment There are two main aspects of housetraining: 1) encouraging a preference for a specific surface (for example, dirt or grass) or location, and 2) encouraging inhibition of urination or defecation until the appropriate location is accessible. The first age at which a dog is able to voluntarily inhibit elimination is at 8½ weeks of age. Appropriate housetraining for dogs involves exposure to the preferred surface for elimination starting at that age, absence of physical punishment, emphasis on positive reinforcement, frequent trips to the desired area, continuous supervision to avoid indoor accidents, quickly and completely cleaning up any accidents, and startling the dog to interrupt it only when the dog is caught in the act of eliminating in an inappropriate place. Punishment is not helpful and may be counterproductive. Dogs with submissive urination should never be startled. These are already anxious, uncertain dogs, and any punishment will worsen the behavior.  Taking dogs outside 15 to 30 minutes after eating and immediately after play, awakening, or if they slow down, can help speed housetraining. Housetraining an older dog is more a matter of fine-tuning the dog’s behavior and encouraging it to select a more appropriate surface or location. The presence of an older dog may help when housetraining a puppy, because the puppy can follow the lead of the older dog. Prevention is important and owners should know that puppies obtained from pet stores are usually much more difficult to housetrain than those obtained from other sources. Puppies in a pet store are generally not taken out of their cages often and do not have to inhibit elimination. They also may have learned to play with or eat feces.  Dogs with medical conditions can urinate and defecate inappropriately. A veterinarian can rule out any underlying medical conditions. ## Other Canine Behavior Problems Some common behavior problems of dogs are identified below. Many can be treated with behavior modification programs that focus on desensitization and counterconditioning ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). This is very important in the early treatment of fears, phobias, and anxieties. Your veterinarian might also prescribe medication to help your pet.  Abnormal ingestive behavior is eating unusual amounts or types of food or nonfood items. This includes pica (eating nonfood items), eating feces (coprophagia), drinking too much water, scavenging (seeking out food in the garbage or off countertops), anorexia (eating too little), overeating, and gorging (eating too fast). These behaviors can be a component of abnormal behaviors (such as compulsive disorders) or due to normal investigative and exploratory behaviors.  Attention-seeking behavior occurs when the dog acts in a way that gets the attention of people who are doing something not directly involving the dog. An example of this would be a puppy that barks to get attention when it is not being actively played with. The owner then reacts to the dog’s bark by giving it attention; both positive (playing with the dog) and negative (yelling at the dog) attention from the owner reinforces this behavior. This may be an undesirable behavior, but it is common and it is certainly a behavior that people unconsciously reinforce in their pets.  Senility, which is also called cognitive dysfunction, is similar in some ways to Alzheimer’s disease in people. Signs include a decrease in social interaction, loss of housetraining, disorientation (getting lost in familiar surroundings), and changes in sleep patterns. Physical and mental stimulation can slow down the signs of senility. Medication and a special diet are also available for treatment. These can delay the progression of signs, but will not reverse them.  Compulsive disorders are repetitive behaviors that occur out of their normal circumstances, or much more often or for much longer periods than is normal (for example, incessant licking). The dog spends so much time doing the compulsive behavior that it does not have time for normal activities. Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors that have no obvious purpose or function.  False pregnancy is a condition during which a dog acts as though it is pregnant, but is not. The dog may make a nest and may gather small objects that it protects as if they were puppies.  Destructive behaviors include chewing, stealing, getting into the trash, and digging. They are normal exploratory behaviors seen in unsupervised dogs that aren\\'t busy doing desirable activities. Exercise, reward-based training, and social enrichment can help when owners are home. When unsupervised, dogs should be confined away from areas they can destroy and given appropriate toys or chews.  Fear is a normal response to a real or perceived threat. Anxiety is a response to fear or apprehension when an animal anticipates a threat. Fear and anxiety have signs that overlap. Some nonspecific signs, such as avoidance, shaking, and trembling, can be characteristic of both fear and anxiety. Phobia is an exaggerated fear response that is sudden and profound and results in panic.  Hyperactivity is an extremely high level of activity that does not respond to correction, redirection, or restraint. True hyperactivity is rare in dogs and is different from overactivity. Overactive dogs are highly energetic and active, but are able to calm down and respond to human control.  Neophobia(fear of new things) is active avoidance, escape, or anxiety directed at unfamiliar objects and situations.  Noise phobia consists of a sudden and profound response to noise that leads to intense anxiety, panic, or attempts to escape confinement. The most common form is fear of thunderstorms, although fear of fireworks or other loud noises is also common.  Separation anxiety is a syndrome in which a dog panics when it is left alone. It causes intense anxiety and may lead the dog to bark, pace, or eliminate inside the house. Dogs that are confined commonly destroy kennels, walls, or doors in an attempt to reunite with their owners. Signs are often most severe within the first 15 to 30 minutes of the dog being left alone.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/special-pet-topics/health-and-the-human-animal-bond/animal-welfare\\nname: Animal Welfare\\ndocument: Most responsible pet owners and handlers have good intentions for their pets’ welfare, and they work to reduce and prevent pain and promote well-being and pleasure in their companion animals. However, animal neglect and abuse still occur. People who intentionally and deliberately abuse animals are more likely to do the same to vulnerable human members of their household, such as children or the elderly. Reporting suspected animal abuse to local authorities might help save people from abuse, too.  Extreme cases of abuse are less common than cases of neglect and general poor care, some of which may not be done on purpose. This might include failing to feed the animal a proper, nutritious diet, not providing adequate space or housing, or simply not providing regular veterinary care or vaccinations.  Another serious problem occurs with animal hoarders, who may be mentally ill. Animal hoarders, perhaps without realizing it or intending to, acquire more animals than they can care for properly. Some communities address cases of animal hoarding by bringing in both animal control and mental health agencies.  A larger, society-wide animal welfare problem is the abandoning or killing of companion animals. Although the number of people who give up or abandon pets has dropped, the problem is still widespread. Pet owners who are not knowledgeable about animal care and training are more likely to relinquish their pets, especially if the pet has a behavior problem or if the owner had unrealistic expectations about life with a pet.  If you are considering becoming a pet owner for the first time, or keeping a new type of pet, it is highly recommended that you do research about the particular type of animal before you bring one home. This should include its diet and exercise needs, housing, amount of human interaction or daily care needed, and regular health care, including recommendations about spaying or neutering. Having your pet spayed or neutered before it matures will prevent unwanted litters, but for dogs, at least, there are other things to take into account. Routine spaying and neutering has been common in the US and was thought to provide health benefits without any drawbacks. However, recent research has shown that while there may be some health benefits, there are also some increased health risks. Consulting with a veterinarian is the best way to make an informed decision. Breeders, veterinarians, and animal shelters can help owners choose an appropriate pet and understand their responsibilities to the animal, reducing the likelihood that the owner will eventually give up the pet because it became a burden instead of a joy.  ## For More Information Also see professional content regarding animal welfare.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavioral-medicine-introduction/treatment-of-behavior-problems-in-animals\\nname: Treatment of Behavior Problems in Animals\\ndocument: With production animals, treatment focuses on group management, environmental or housing modifications, and, in some cases, moving individual animals out of their groups or into other groups.  With companion animals, treatment of behavior problems varies with diagnosis and prognosis. In general, the behavior treatment plan recommendations encompass 3 categories:  ## Management of Behavior Problems in Animals Keys to managing behavior problems in animals include meeting the pet\\'s behavioral needs, avoiding stimuli that incite undesirable behavior, and preventing rehearsal of undesirable behavior.  Meeting the animal\\'s needs can improve behavior and welfare, especially if the inability to express normal behavior is a contributing motivation to performing the undesirable behavior. Needs vary between species, and the motivation to meet those needs varies between individuals.  Initially, prevention is necessary to avoid further compromising the pet’s welfare and to ensure safety of the pet, owner, and any target of the problem behavior. Repetition of the behavior further aggravates the problem by triggering unwanted emotional states, rehearsing undesirable behavior, and teaching the animal to repeat or intensify the undesirable behavior in the future.  Each exposure in which the outcome is unpleasant can condition further fear and anxiety. Therefore, improvement is generally a slow and gradual process, and owners must have realistic expectations of what can be achieved.  To prevent repetition, either the stimuli that incites the problem behavior can be kept away from the pet or the pet can be kept away from the stimuli. Environmental modifications (eg, distance, visual barriers, auditory barriers, physical barriers) may be required to achieve this. ## Modification of Behavior Problems in Animals Modifying the pet’s behavior is accomplished by applying the principles of learning and behavior modification, primarily achieving and rewarding desirable outcomes along with using products that improve safety, decrease fear and anxiety, or help to achieve the desired response more effectively (eg, muzzles, head halters, no-pull harnesses, etc).  The most commonly used behavioral techniques include habituation, extinction, counterconditioning and desensitization, response substitution, and shaping.  Flooding is often talked about but seldom used because the practice is often inhumane and is likely to make most animals\\' behaviors worse.  Although punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people correctly use this technique. In addition, there are both humane and safety issues with the use of positive punishment.  Most of the humane, passive, or positive techniques involved in behavior modification in pets focus on cultivating a positive conditioned emotional response and developing the pet\\'s coping skills through reinforcement of desirable behaviors in the presence of an inciting trigger. The longterm goal is not only to prevent undesirable behaviors but also to teach the pet a more desirable way to feel or respond when the inciting stimulus occurs. These techniques are not hard to learn and, together with preventive strategies, are often very successful. In fact, dogs trained with rewards have fewer behavior problems, less fear and anxiety, and less avoidance than dogs trained with punishment.  The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in the techniques of behavior modification and their associated implementation strategies.  ### Behavior Modification Principles ### Classical Conditioning The following terms are used in classical conditioning:  The pairing of an unconditioned stimulus with a neutral stimulus results in a conditioned stimulus and a conditioned response.  Classical conditioning can occur in both positive and negative ways. Examples of a conditioned emotional response include the following:  Problems arise when a fearful conditioned emotional response is established toward a previously neutral stimulus (visual, olfactory, auditory, animate, inanimate) by repeated pairing with a fear-producing stimulus. Once this occurs, the stimulus itself will elicit the fear response.  For example, when a pet is meeting new people (neutral stimulus) and lunges or barks, the use of positive punishment (unconditioned stimulus), such as choke collars, prong collars, shock, and pinning to inhibit the undesirable behavior, may condition a new fear-conditioned emotional response in which unfamiliar people now represent a fear-conditioned stimulus.  A visit to the veterinary clinic that begins as a neutral situation can quickly become fear evoking if it is associated with unpleasant outcomes or is amplified by owner anxiety. In addition, all of the stimuli (sights, sounds, smells) associated with the event also become conditioned stimuli for fear.  In much the same way, rain, wind, darkening skies, and lightning can quickly become conditioned, fear-evoking stimuli for pets fearful of thunder. ### Counterconditioning and Desensitization Counterconditioning involves the consistent and repeated pairing of a stimulus that evokes an unpleasant response with something that is emotionally positive (eg, a reward) until a positive emotional association is made. To be successful, counterconditioning should be coupled with desensitization. In desensitization, the stimulus is minimized or decreased (eg, by decreasing volume, increasing distance, changing the environment, or modifying the stimulus to something less threatening) to a level that does not evoke the fear response. Once a positive emotional association is made at the decreased level, rewards can be paired with stimuli of gradually increasing intensity.  Desensitization and counterconditioning are extremely time-consuming. The exercises must be constantly repeated so that the response is altered to a positive emotional one. All stimuli (sights, sounds, odors, tactile sensations) that evoke fear must be considered. Clients often want both quicker fixes and less work. However, moving too quickly provokes anxiety and sabotages any behavior modification program. ### Extinction The ending of a behavior once all reinforcement is removed is termed extinction. For example, if people pet a dog that jumps up on them for attention, the behavior continues; if they stop, the dog will eventually extinguish its response because the reward is no longer there.  However, any form of intermittent reinforcement—even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping—will prolong the performance of the response. Valuable rewards, a long history of performance, and intermittent reinforcement all increase resistance to extinction.  Owners also must be prepared for the intensity of the behavior to initially increase before it is extinguished; this is called an extinction burst. Giving in will make extinction even more difficult as the animal learns that higher-intensity behaviors achieve the desired outcome. ### Flooding Flooding is used to treat fears of harmless stimuli by forcing the animal to stay in the stimuli\\'s presence until the fear is extinguished. This procedure is seldom effective and has welfare implications in dogs because it initially enhances fear and cannot be stopped until all physiological and emotional signs of fear are gone. If done improperly, flooding can therefore increase problem behaviors (sensitization).  In practice, a controlled level of flooding, in which the stimulus is presented at a level low enough to cause mild fear and the pet is not removed until it habituates, is quite often used as a component of behavior modification. This process can then be combined with reinforcement—ie, the pet is given something rewarding (positive reinforcement), or the stimulus is removed (negative reinforcement), when the fear response subsides or abates. ### Habituation Habituation is the gradual lessening of a response to a stimulus. Usually this occurs with repeated presentation of a stimulus, whereby the animal learns that the stimulus does not signal anything important. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road might at first run away when traffic passes but eventually learn to ignore it.  Stimuli associated with potentially adverse consequences are more difficult to extinguish with habituation than other stimuli. In prey species, responses to sounds associated with predators would be difficult to habituate because the responses have been selected for and generally are adaptive.  If the fear response is too intense, the animal may become increasingly more fearful of the stimulus instead of habituating. This is termed sensitization.  If an extended interval has occurred since the time an animal last experienced a stimulus to which it had habituated, the animal may again react when reexposed to the stimulus. This is termed spontaneous recovery. ### Operant Conditioning Operant conditioning is a method based on making an association between a behavior and the consequences of that behavior. The results either increase or decrease the likelihood of future responses. There are 4 types of behavior-consequence relations: positive and negative punishment and positive and negative reinforcement. \"Negative\" refers to the removal of a stimulus, and \"positive\" refers to the application of a stimulus. Reinforcement increases the likelihood a behavior will be repeated, and punishment leads to a decrease in behavior.  Positive reinforcement occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is applied (generally something pleasant or appealing), so the behavior is increased in the future. In positive reinforcement training, a reward should be given immediately and consistently following the behavior until the\\xa0behavior is reliably repeated. If the behavior is to be trained on command or cue, a signal (eg, word, hand sign) should then be added before the behavior-reward sequence.  Once learned, behavior can be reinforced on a variable schedule, so that the period of time or number of responses before the reward is given is varied. Rewards are used for positive reinforcement; however, a reward is not synonymous with positive reinforcement. Unless there is a clear relationship (timing, consistency, contiguity) between the behavior and the reward, the reward does not achieve the goal of positively reinforcing behavior.  Negative reinforcement occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is removed (generally something unpleasant) and the behavior is increased in the future. Negative reinforcement must not be confused with punishment because punishment decreases behaviors, and reinforcement increases behaviors.  One example of negative reinforcement is avoidance or escape behavior. For example, if an animal anticipates an unpleasant outcome (eg, meeting another dog, veterinary visit), then the aversive outcome will not occur if the animal retreats. Similarly, if the owner puts pressure on a head halter until the desired behavior (eg, sit, back up) is achieved, the release of tension is negative reinforcement. One potential consequence of negative reinforcement is that if a pet’s threats or aggression lead to removal of a stimulus (eg, dog, delivery person, owner), the behavior is reinforced by the retreat of the stimulus.  Positive punishment occurs when, as a consequence of the behavior, something is applied (generally something unpleasant) and the behavior is decreased in the future. For positive punishment to be successful, the aversive stimulus (eg, startling with a loud noise, spraying compressed air) must occur sufficiently close to the onset of the behavior, with complete consistency and at an appropriate intensity, that the probability of the behavior\\'s occurring in the future is lessened.  In positive punishment, if behavior does not decrease after the first few applications, then the punishment is not being appropriately timed, or the behavior is too strongly motivated, to be deterred by punishment.  Positive punishment applied by a person (eg, owner, trainer) is intended to cause the pet to become fearful of repeating the behavior. In fact, numerous studies have demonstrated that positive punishment–based training and confrontational techniques are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression. A potential consequence is that the pet becomes fearful or defensive to the punisher or to an approaching hand. Relationships with people should always remain emotionally pleasant. Also, if an unpleasant consequence occurs only when the owner is present, the behavior may continue in the owner’s absence.  Another problem with positive punishment is that punishment paired with exposure to a stimulus (eg cars, other dogs, strangers) can result in a conditioned fear of the stimulus (see classical conditioning). In addition, some dog owners have been misled by inappropriate training advice that advocates confrontation, with the intent of asserting leadership (dominance). Often, punishment is more about the owner’s anger than about changing the pet\\'s behavior.  Punishment cannot be used to achieve desirable behaviors, only to stop what is undesirable. If the goal is to make the pet fearful of repeating an undesirable behavior (eg, garbage raiding, taking things from counters, chewing plants) or to keep the pet away from an area (room, couch, bed), then environmental or pet-activated punishment (eg, motion detector alarms or sprays, upside-down carpet runners, aversive tastes, double-sided tape, or bark-activated sprays) or remote punishment (eg, spraying water while out of sight, remote-activated alarm or spray) might be most appropriate. However, before focusing on how to stop what is undesirable, the owner should first focus on providing a desirable alternative to allow the pet to meet its behavioral needs (eg, where to sleep, where to climb, what to chew).  Negative punishment occurs when, as a consequence of the undesirable behavior, something is removed (generally something pleasant or appealing) and the behavior is decreased in the future. For example, if the pet is receiving affection or play when an undesirable behavior (eg, play biting, mouthing, mounting, jumping) begins, the consequence of immediate removal of the play or affection will \"negatively\" punish the undesirable behavior. However, unless the pet can determine what behavior leads to the removal of play or affection, the undesirable behavior may actually intensify because of frustration over not receiving its reward (see extinction). The owner should also focus on positively reinforcing a desirable alternative behavior to meet that pet\\'s behavioral needs (eg, play or affection when the animal is calm). ### Overlearning Overlearning is the repeated evocation and expression of an already learned response. It is a phenomenon frequently used in training for specific events but may be underused in preventing fearful responses in dogs. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, increases the resistance to extinction, and increases the probability that the response will become automatic, or the response of first choice, when circumstances are similar. ### Premack Principle The Premack principle is that when a more desirable behavior—from the animal\\'s perspective—is made contingent on a less desirable behavior, the less desirable behavior is more likely to be repeated. Thus, the more desirable behavior serves as the reinforcer. For example, if a pet wants to go out or cross the street for its walk, the owner can train a sit-stay before each of these behaviors. A horse or dog that wants to walk ahead can be taught that walking on a slack rein or leash will result in this behavior. ### First-Order Reinforcers A first-order reinforcer, more commonly known as a reward (or a primary reinforcer), is an event that is naturally reinforcing. A reward is anything desirable to the pet, from an activity such as petting, walking, or play to an item such as a toy, food, chew, or treat. ### Second-Order Reinforcers A second-order reinforcer, also called a conditioned reinforcer, is an event that is reinforcing because of its association with a first-order reinforcer. By being repeatedly and continuously paired with a primary reward such as a toy or treat, second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would, as long as the pairing is repeatedly maintained. Second-order reinforcers can be created as a signal that can be used at a distance to convey that a reward is coming. The following are examples of second-order reinforcers:  Clicker training is an excellent way to immediately “mark” desirable responses, gradually shape new or more desirable (eg, longer, more relaxed) behaviors, or associate a positive emotional response with the stimulus. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing; however, once mastery is achieved, the animal can be reinforced each time the desired behavior is observed. ### Response Substitution Response substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desirable one. For example, high-value rewards can be used to train desirable target behaviors that are alternatives to an undesirable behavior. However, if the undesirable behavior is part of the pet’s natural repertoire (eg, greeting, barking), alternative behaviors can be particularly difficult to train. Specific examples of response substitution include training a dog to sit or lie down as an alternative to jumping up, mounting, or play biting; or training to sit, walk on loose leash, or back up, rather than forging ahead or running out the door.  Training should begin in a variety of environments where success can be most readily achieved. If the desired endpoint for the new response is for the animal to be quiet and calm, the owner must learn to read the pet\\'s body posture, facial expressions, and breathing to be able to gradually shape the desired behavior. Training can then move to environments with increasing distractions and locations where the undesirable behavior is most likely to occur. Alternatively, the pet might be enticed to engage in a behavior that is incompatible with the undesirable behavior (eg, teaching the dog to fetch a toy when visitors arrive instead of jumping up).  To replace the undesirable behavior with one that is desirable, response substitution can be coupled with desensitization by beginning training with stimuli of low enough intensity while training the target behaviors (eg, relaxation) with high-value rewards. However, for pets that are fearful or anxious, the focus should be on desensitization and counterconditioning to change the pet’s emotional state, rather than the behavioral response. ### Shaping Shaping works through gradual approximations of a desirable behavior and allows the animal to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For instance, when teaching a puppy to sit, providing a food reward for a slight squat will increase the probability that squatting will be repeated. Over time, squatting behavior is ultimately rewarded only when it more closely resembles a sit, and finally, when it becomes a true sit. Shaping can also be used to reward both progressive increases in duration and frequency of a more desirable behavior. ## Medication for Behavior Problems in Animals Psychotropic drugs and adjunctive treatments (eg, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products, pheromones, nutritional therapies) can be used to reestablish a more stable emotional state and to improve trainability in patients that are anxious, fearful, or overly reactive. Drugs might also be effective in the treatment of behavior that is abnormal or pathological. In addition, drugs may be indicated to improve compromised welfare.  Although drugs can improve the animal\\'s emotional state and facilitate new learning, only with concurrent behavior modification can new neuronal pathways be established, new behaviors learned, and fearful responses to stimuli changed to positive ones.  Before dispensing drugs, clinicians should rule out underlying medical problems that might be causing or contributing to behavioral signs or that might have an impact on drug selection and use.  To rule out underlying medical problems, veterinarians should perform a physical examination and collect a minimum database (CBC, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, and measurement of serum thyroxine concentration—plus in cats, testing for both feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus). Additional testing, such as blood pressure measurements, thoracic and abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, and thyroid panel, may also be indicated, depending on the patient, differential diagnoses, and medication considered.  Evidence-based decision-making is a way to provide the owner with the best treatment options. Treatment should be selected using the evidence combined with the clinician’s expertise regarding the specific animal, client, and problem.  Very few drugs have been adequately tested in rigorous randomized controlled trials for use in veterinary behavioral therapy. In fact, most drugs used in veterinary behavioral therapy are human drugs, very few of which have had pharmacokinetics established for animal species. Use of human drugs in animals can lead to inaccuracies regarding dosage, duration of effect, contraindications, and adverse effects. In addition, these drugs have a wide range of published dosages based on the application, individual variability, and desired outcome. Therefore, before dispensing any of these medications, practitioners prescribing drugs to modify behavior must remain current with veterinary behavior literature with respect to indications, recommended dosages, evidence of efficacy, potential adverse effects, and contraindications.  Depending on the drug and patient, compounding may be required to achieve an appropriate dosage and formulation for administration; however, reformulation may alter a drug’s pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and stability. Studies on the use of transdermal preparations of behavioral drugs such as fluoxetine, amitripyline, and buspirone have found little to no absorption transdermally.  Considerations for medication choice include the following:  Drugs are differentiated not only by their drug class but also by their indications as \"baseline\" daily medications, \"situational\" medications, or adjunctive therapies.  Baseline medications usually are used regularly (daily to multiple times daily). Some drugs in this category may take weeks to reach optimal therapeutic effect. Baseline medications tend to work best for chronic or unpredictable stimuli that may elicit the behavior problem. Some examples of drugs that fall in the baseline category include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.  Especially for patients with multiple behavior problems, a baseline medication can create a foundation for which a situational medication or adjunctive therapy could be synergistic or complementary:  Situational medications have a short onset to effect and a short duration of effect. Situational medications can either be used on a regular basis—usually in combination with a baseline medication—or as needed. Situational medications tend to work best for acute, predictable stimuli that may elicit an undesirable behavior. Examples of situational medications include alpha-2 agonists, benzodiazepines, trazodone, and gabapentin.  Adjunctive therapy, like baseline medication, involves regular (daily to multiple times daily) use.  A variety of adjunctive therapies (eg, dietary supplements, nutraceuticals, herbal products, nutritional therapies, pheromones, therapy wraps) have been used to treat fear and anxiety.  In reported studies, the following have been found to have potential therapeutic effects to calm and decrease underlying fear and anxiety:  In reported studies, the following have been found to have potential therapeutic effects for cognitive decline: ## Key Points ## For More Information\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/behavior/behavioral-medicine-introduction/prognosis-of-behavior-problems-in-animals\\nname: Prognosis of Behavior Problems in Animals\\ndocument: If animals with behavioral disorders are to improve, client understanding and compliance are critical. The strategy to modify undesirable behavior requires the owner to be prepared and capable of identifying each situation that elicits the undesirable behavior, assessing risk, maintaining safety, and substituting a more desirable behavioral response. Therefore, avoiding or preventing the provocative situation, especially initially, is important.  Important prognostic and risk considerations to review with the owner include the following:  In addition, special consideration will need to be given in cases of aggression to evaluate risk and ensure safety. For guidelines on risk factor assessment, see the European Society of Veterinary Clinical Ethology (ESVCE) website.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/behavior-of-horses/treatment-of-behavior-problems-in-horses\\nname: Treatment of Behavior Problems in Horses\\ndocument: The diagnosis, treatment, and expected outcome of a behavior problem vary depending on the underlying issue. Early on, owners will usually need to avoid situations that trigger the abnormal behavior. After implementing treatment techniques, the problematic situations might be slowly reintroduced under the recommendations of the overseeing veterinarian. Repetition of the behavior tends to worsen the problem, especially if the behavior successfully accomplishes the intended goal (for example, a horse that acts aggressively to avoid being handled). Treatment for abnormal behaviors takes time and commitment from horse owners. Quick fixes or \"magic pills\" do not exist for behavior problems. The environment may need to be modified to keep the horse away from areas where the problem occurs or away from stimuli that trigger the problem. In addition, the safety of people, other animals, and the horse itself must be considered, especially in the case of aggression. Modifying a horse\\'s behavior involves behavior modification techniques to promote and reward desirable behaviors; the use of products that improve safety, reduce anxiety, or facilitate improvements; and, possibly, medications. With treatment, improvement is usually a slow and gradual process.  ## Behavior Modification in Horses The most commonly used techniques to modify animal behavior include habituation, extinction, desensitization, counterconditioning, response substitution, and shaping. A behavior modification technique called flooding (see Flooding, below) is only used rarely because it has a high potential to make animals worse. While it is claimed that punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people correctly employ punishment. For punishment (for example, screaming at the horse) to be successful, it must occur sufficiently close to the start of\\xa0the behavior. Most punishments are inappropriate in context, duration, or time of application. Even when used correctly, punishment may only suppress the unwanted behavior, rather than eliminate it completely.  Most of the humane, passive, or positive techniques involved in behavior modification are not hard to learn and are successfully employed as preventive techniques. They do require a regular investment of time and effort, however. The following is a short review of the basic principles involved in the techniques, and their associated strategies.  Habituation is an elementary form of learning that involves no rewards. It is merely the ending of or decrease in a response to a stimulus that results from repeated or prolonged exposure to that stimulus. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road may at first run away when traffic passes, but eventually learn to ignore it. A horse that habituates to one type of sound does not, as a consequence of this habituation, become habituated to other sounds. Habituation is distinct from failing to respond to stimulation as a result of fatigue or injury. The effects of habituation are generally long lasting. If a horse is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful stimulus (such as to a predator) without being harmed, habituation does not generally occur. Responses to dangerous stimuli seem to have an inherited resistance to habituation. If the fear response is too intense, instead of habituation the animal may become increasingly more fearful of the stimulus. This is termed sensitization.  Spontaneous recovery is associated with habituation. If there is a long time between when a horse has experienced an\\xa0event to which it had habituated and re-exposure to the same event, the horse may again react.  Conditioning refers to associations between stimuli and behavior. For example, a horse that touches an electric fence will receive a painful shock. It will quickly learn to avoid touching the fence. The sight of the fence itself will then become associated with the shock. Classical conditioning can occur in both positive and negative ways. An example of positive response is the pairing of an object with a treat. If the horse sees an object every time that it receives a treat, it will react positively to the object in the future, even if a treat is no longer present.  Reinforcement is any event that increases the chance that a certain behavior will\\xa0be repeated. When positive reinforcement (such as a reward) is used in training, there is a positive relationship between the behavior and its consequences. The more the horse does a behavior, the more it gets positive reinforcement and what it gets is good. This makes that behavior increase. A negative reinforcement (which is mistakenly thought of as punishment by many people) is something unpleasant that increases a behavior when it is removed. For example, most horses find the application of spurs to be painful. When the horse starts moving, the spurring stops. This reinforces the behavior the rider wanted. Over time, the horse will start moving as soon as the spurs are applied.  Second-order reinforcers are signals that can be used at a distance to let the horse know that the reward is coming. Commonly used second-order reinforcers are words, such as “good girl,” hand signals, and whistles. By carefully pairing these with a primary reward (such as food), second-order reinforcers encourage the same response that the reward would.  Extinction is a response that stops when the reward is removed. For example, if a horse was used to getting a carrot as a treat for coming up to the fence of a paddock, but then the owner stopped giving it a carrot, the horse would eventually stop coming over to the fence. The more valuable the original reinforcer, the longer the reinforcement has been continuing, and the more uncertainty there is about whether the reward has been truly removed, the greater the resistance to extinction.  Resistance to extinction (and thus a continuation of the behavior) can also occur even without reinforcement if the reward was good enough and was tightly linked to the behavior. Because there is often an association between getting the reward and the intensity of the behavior, the intensity or frequency of the behavior you are trying to eliminate usually increases at the beginning of extinction. In other words, a behavior you are trying to extinguish may get worse before it gets better. It is critical that you do not give in. Giving in will only make extinction more difficult. The horse will learn that, although your threshold has increased, the horse can override it by working harder.  Overlearning is the repeated performance of an already learned behavior. It is frequently used in training for specific events. Overlearning accomplishes 3 things: it delays forgetting, it increases the resistance to extinction, and it increases the chance that the response will become an automatic or “knee-jerk” response in similar situations. This aspect can be useful in teaching a horse to overcome fear or anxiety.  Shaping is a training technique that works well for horses that do not know what response is desired by the trainer. Shaping works through gradual approximations and allows the horse to be rewarded initially for any behavior that resembles the desired behavior. For example, when teaching a horse to load on a trailer, at first you might praise and stroke the horse for just taking 1 or 2 steps toward the trailer’s ramp. Next, you would reward it for walking calmly up to the ramp. Finally, the horse would be rewarded only for completely entering the trailer.  Desensitization is a way to teach a horse to tolerate a situation by exposing it to the problem when it is minimized or reduced to a level that does not cause fear. As long as the horse does not act fearful, the intensity can be slowly increased in a series of small steps. For example, a horse that is fearful of having its hooves picked may need to be desensitized to having its feet handled. This could be started by first rubbing and massaging the upper leg, then gradually working down to the hoof. The leg could also be picked up and held for a few seconds, gradually increasing that to several minutes over a series of training sessions.  Counterconditioning is a method for reducing undesirable behavior by teaching the horse to replace it with another more favorable behavior. In the hoof-picking example, the horse will learn faster if it is first taught to stand calmly and relax in exchange for a treat. The horse must be absolutely quiet and calm, and convey by its\\xa0eyes, body posture, and ear position that\\xa0it is not alarmed. Once this behavior is\\xa0learned, the desensitization is added by handling the leg closer and closer to the hoof. If at any time the horse starts to become anxious or agitated, the trainer should handle a higher part of the leg until the horse relaxes again. There is no point in forcing the horse to submit to handling if it is clearly distressed. Relaxation is the first step to changing the behavior. Counterconditioning coupled with desensitization is an effective yet time-consuming technique. The exercises must be repeated often so that the fearful response decreases until it disappears.  Flooding is prolonged exposure to a stimulus until the horse eventually stops reacting. This is the opposite of the approach taken in desensitization. It is far\\xa0more stressful than any of the other treatment strategies and if not used correctly could make things worse. This technique should be used only by a professional and only as a last resort.  Punishment is also known as aversive conditioning. It is any unpleasant event that lowers the chance that a behavior will be repeated. It can involve applying something unpleasant (called positive punishment) or removing something that is desirable or appealing (called negative punishment). Punishment is not the same as negative reinforcement (see above). To be most successful, punishment must occur as early as possible (within a few seconds of the start of the behavior), and it must be consistent and appropriate. Critical factors in punishment include timing, consistency, appropriate intensity, and the presence of a reward after the undesirable behavior ends. This is the most frequently ignored part of treatment for people whose horses have behavior problems. Owners often resort to physical punishment as the first choice, but punishment does not need to be physical. Furthermore, punishment is just as hard to use correctly as counterconditioning and desensitization. Punishment is never an “easy out” and has a high chance of failure. It can also lead to other negative consequences, such as increased fear or aggression. If a person applies the punishment, the horse may become fearful of that person or only avoid the behavior when that person is present (and continue the behavior in the person\\'s absence). This is helpful, because relationships with people should always remain positive. In addition, punishment cannot be used to achieve desirable behaviors, only to stop what is undesirable. However, before focusing on how to stop what is undesirable, the owner should first focus on providing a desirable alternative.  Response substitution involves the replacement of an undesirable response with a desirable one. This often involves training a desirable behavior, then prompting the horse to perform that behavior during times when the undesired behavior typically occurs. If the horse responds favorably, the horse is rewarded. Alternatively, the horse could be trained to do a task that is incompatible with the undesired behavior. For example, teaching a horse to back up instead of bolting.  The Premack Principle states that more likely behaviors will reinforce less likely behaviors. If a less desirable behavior must be performed in order to accomplish a desired one, it is more likely that the less desirable behavior will occur. For example, a horse that wants to walk ahead can be taught that walking on a slack rein can result in this behavior. ## Use of Medication to Treat Behavior\\xa0Problems Your veterinarian may, in some cases, prescribe medication to help treat a behavior problem in your horse. Drugs may help normalize a horse\\'s emotions and improve your ability to train anxious, overreactive, or fearful animals. In some cases, they can also improve a horse\\'s welfare. Drug treatment for almost any behavior change is most useful when combined with behavior modification, which is how new behaviors are learned.  In recent years there has been an increase in the use of medication to treat a variety of behavior problems in domestic animals. There are a number of potential disadvantages to the use of medication for treating these problems, however, and you should know that there is no “magic bullet” that will easily and quickly solve the problem. The limitations of medication use include the potential for adverse effects, the cost, the need to treat for a considerable length of time before the medication takes effect, limited information on what medication is most effective, and the potential that the problem will reappear once the medication is withdrawn.  Your veterinarian can discuss whether medication might be appropriate for your horse. ## For More Information Also see professional content regarding behavior problems in horses.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/exotic-and-laboratory-animals/ratites/management-of-ratites\\nname: Management of Ratites\\ndocument: Physical restraint of ratites is different for each species. An ostrich’s head can be caught by hand or hook, and a hood can be placed over its head. Once hooded, an ostrich\\'s head should be maintained below the level of its body to restrict it from kicking its legs forward. An ostrich kick can seriously injure a handler and, once captured, the bird will quickly try to back up and kick anyone in front of its body. Because an ostrich will back up when its head is held, an assistant should be positioned behind the bird to push as the person holding its head leads the ostrich forward. Emus must be handled from behind, grasping the wings and lifting the bird slightly upward and back. The front of the bird should be avoided to prevent being injured by the claws on the feet, because, as with all ratites, emus will kick forward to try to escape. Rheas are handled much like emus. Some handlers use hoods to facilitate handling emus and rheas, although this technique is not as effective as it is with ostriches.  Juvenile birds from 4 months of age to yearlings are best handled by slowly and calmly herding them into an enclosed barn. If they cannot see out of an enclosure and are crowded into a corner, they will often sit if not startled. When calmly herded into a confined area, young birds can easily be sexed, banded, and administered antiparasitic medication, and diagnostic samples (eg, blood) can be collected. If there is no enclosed area, portable panels with plywood or plastic applied can be used to herd the birds into a desired space.  ## Physical and Laboratory Examination of Ratites Before a bird is restrained, it should be examined from a distance while walking/running in its enclosure for conformation, gait, body condition, respiration rate and character, and behavior-related problems.  The enclosure should be inspected for fresh droppings and urine. Green urates may be an indication of hepatitis, whereas dry, hard, fecal material is common in birds that are dehydrated or suffering from gastrointestinal impaction. The droppings should be examined for tapeworm segments and collected for fecal flotation and direct parasite evaluation.  The eyes and sinuses are examined for any discharge or swelling, and the beak and oral cavity are examined for any lesions. The neck is palpated, especially in the area of the thoracic inlet, for any swellings.  Overall body condition should be noted and is determined by the epaxial muscle mass, rated on a scale of 1–9, with 1 being emaciated and 9 obese. The bird\\'s feathers and skin should always be examined for feather-destructive behavior, external parasites, and lesions. Evaluation of the cranial coelomic cavity should be accompanied by auscultation of the heart and lungs/air sacs. Heart rhythm and rate are determined during auscultation, as well as listening for any abnormal lung and air sac sounds while the animal is breathing. The caudal coelom is palpated from the ventriculus, which lies immediately caudal to the breastplate, to the proventriculus, located between the legs. The caudal coelom is palpated and balloted for any evidence of coelomic fluid and/or retained eggs.  Finally, a cloacal examination is performed to verify normal anatomy. When indicated, samples for microbial culture can be collected from the trachea, cloaca, and caudal oviduct, and blood can be collected for a CBC and serum chemistry panel. (For hematologic and serum biochemical reference ranges for ostriches, see Table # Hematologic Reference Ranges in Ferretsa and see Table # Serum Biochemical Analysis Reference Ranges). Sodium heparin is the preferred anticoagulant for both the CBC and serum chemistry panel. A slide should be prepared immediately for cytologic evaluation.  Recommended sites for venipuncture and catheterization in ostriches and rheas are the cutaneous ulnar veins on\\xa0the ventral side of the wings and the medial metatarsal veins. In emus, the jugular vein and medial metatarsal vein are the blood collection sites of choice. Venipuncture of the jugular vein is more difficult in ostriches because of their size and because sudden movement by the bird can result in lacerations and exsanguination. In debilitated ratites, even ostriches, catheterization (adults, 14-gauge, 13-cm catheter) of the jugular vein is easy and provides a readily accessible port to the vascular system. The right jugular vein is more developed than the left. ## Anesthesia in Ratites Chemical restraint for handling and surgical procedures in ratites involve typical veterinary drugs. Anesthesia may be induced in younger birds with isoflurane or sevoflurane using the same procedures as with small animals. Intubation for maintenance is recommended; however, the cuff should not be inflated, because of the possibility of pressure necrosis (birds have complete tracheal rings that do not expand with the tracheal cuff). Xylazine and ketamine combinations are commonly administered for short procedures on induction, followed by intubation and gas anesthesia. Xylazine administered at 2.5 mg/kg, IV, followed, after sedative effect is noticed, by ketamine at 1 mg/kg, is an effective protocol. However, xylazine has notable cardiorespiratory depressant effects and should not be administered to severely ill birds. Also, xylazine is not recommended as a premedication for inhalation anesthesia, because it may greatly enhance the cardiodepressant effects of gas anesthetic agents.  For chemical sedation and restraint, the following protocols have been successful in ostriches. As an initial sedative, acepromazine (0.25 mg/kg, IM) or xylazine (1 mg/kg, IM) can be administered. After waiting approximately 20 minutes for the sedatives to take effect, the anesthetic agent can be administered. If acepromazine is used as the preanesthetic agent, either propofol (4 mg/kg, IV) or ketamine (5 mg/kg, IV) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg, IV) or tiletamine/zolazepam (3 mg/kg, IV) is administered to achieve full sedation. If xylazine is used as the preanesthetic agent, then ketamine (5 mg/kg, IV) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg, IV) or tiletamine/zolazepam (3 mg/kg, IV) is effective for most short-term procedures that need to be performed on the bird.  Recovery may be smoother if diazepam is administered at 0.2 mg/kg, IV or IM. Tiletamine/zolazepam is an induction alternative for ratites, dosed at 2–10 mg/kg, IM, or 1–3 mg/kg, IV, with the higher end of the dose range recommended for emus and rheas. Once the bird has been induced, padding should be placed under the body during the entire procedure to minimize neuropathy and myositis. Ostriches may develop peroneal nerve paralysis when placed in lateral recumbency, without padding, for < 1 hour. Sternal recumbency does not appear to interfere with respiration while anesthetized; however, the large body size of ratites may restrict their ability to breathe. Therefore, manual or mechanical respiration is recommended during general anesthesia to reduce the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of both gas anesthetic agents and physical compression of air sac volume.  The neck should be straight and the head elevated slightly above the body during general anesthesia. Vital signs of ratites should be monitored while under anesthesia along with body temperature (esophageal) to maintain normothermia; intravenous access should be established for drug and fluid administration. During recovery, the bird should be placed in a dark, quiet, preferably padded enclosure in sternal recumbency. Wrapping the body with the legs immobilized under the animal while in sternal recumbency will often allow the bird to recover with minimal struggle. ## Surgical Procedures in Ratites Surgical procedures in ratites generally are related to the GI tract, orthopedics, and trauma repair. Proventriculotomy for foreign body removal and impactions in ratite species is a common surgical procedure. In young birds, incisions should be made carefully, because the abdominal wall is very thin. To perform a proventriculotomy, the bird is positioned in right lateral recumbency, with the left pelvic limb abducted and supported caudally in a stand. In ostriches, the ventriculus is located caudal to the proventriculus in the coelomic cavity; therefore, the surgical incision to access this part of the GI tract should be through a left paramedian approach beginning ~15 cm caudal to the keel.  Yolk sac removal due to nonabsorption and/or infection is common. Egg retention in hens is addressed surgically, and multiple eggs are often removed. Orthopedic surgeries are addressed as in other species with pins, plates, and transfixation casting as needed for fracture repair. Laceration repair is performed as in other species. Upper esophageal tears from attempted hooking (capture) will often heal by second intention and, unless severe, do not require surgical repair.  As in all production animals, the cost of\\xa0surgical correction of many conditions might be greater than the commercial value of the individual animal presented. Producers should be made aware of cost considerations. ## Nutrition in Ratites To date, there has been little reliable research about ratite nutrition. The formulations of commercial diets available are based on studies in Africa and Australia and on extrapolations from available poultry information. Current trends are to feed 14%–20% protein from the time chicks hatch to 3 months of age, reducing the protein level after 3 months of age. Ostriches and rheas are hindgut fermenters and have the ability to digest fiber from a young age. For optimal health and production results, appropriate ratite feed formulated for ostriches, emus, and rheas is recommended. Ostriches, emus, and rheas have significantly different digestive systems and specific nutritional requirements for optimal growth, reproduction, and health. High-quality grass can be used as a grazing supplement for ostriches and rheas. Chicks allowed to hatch in the nest are coprophagous, eating feces from the parents for the first few weeks of life. ## Vaccination of Ratites When indicated in a specific flock, autogenous bacterins for Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and clostridial diseases have been used; however, this is not a common practice, and these products may be difficult to obtain. For emus, equine encephalitis vaccination is recommended. Tissue-culture propagated, inactivated bivalent Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis (EEE, WEE) vaccine prepared and licensed for use in horses, and that may contain equine tetanus antitoxin, has effectively protected emus against EEE and WEE infection. A vaccination protocol is to administer intramuscularly an initial full equine dose at 6 weeks of age, followed by booster vaccinations at 10 weeks of age and at 5- and 6-month intervals thereafter and before and after breeding season (April and September). A booster should be administered when EEE or WEE is identified within 10 miles of the production facility or before transfer to an endemic area. The recommended vaccine protocol (emus) for Clostridium chauvoei (blackleg) using the ruminant vaccine with or without tetanus antitoxin is to administer an initial vaccine at 2 months of age, followed by a booster vaccination at 3 months and then annually after the end of breeding season in April.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/public-health/principles-of-epidemiology/public-health-prevention-strategies\\nname: Public Health Prevention Strategies\\ndocument: When considering opportunities and methods to address human and animal health problems, three stages of prevention are generally recognized:\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/horse-owners/behavior-of-horses/behavior-problems-in-horses\\nname: Behavior Problems in Horses\\ndocument: A variety of behavior problems occur in horses. Some of the most common are those associated with aggression (including aggression towards people), fear and phobias, sexual behavioral problems, performance problems (such as bucking), abnormal eating habits, and undesirable stall behaviors.  Many behavior problems in horses are associated with confinement. Under free-ranging circumstances, horses will wander and spend more than 60% of their day foraging. The reminder of their time is spent standing, lying down, grooming, or engaging in another activity. This same pattern is the preferred one under barn conditions—even with free choice of grain, horses will choose to eat many small meals a day. Because horses are highly social animals, they require contact with others for normal daily maintenance and well-being. Isolating horses can lead to development of problems. Understanding normal equine behavior is important to identify abnormal ones, so that they can then be corrected.  ## Aggression Aggression is a common problem in horses and includes chasing, neck wrestling, kicks and bites, and other threats. Signs of aggression include ears flattened backward, retracted lips, rapid tail movements, snaking, pawing, head bowing, fecal pile display, snoring, squealing, levade (rearing with deeply flexed hindquarters), and threats to kick. Submissive horses respond by avoiding, lowering the neck and head, clamping the tail, and turning away from the aggressive horse.  Aggression toward people is usually seen in stalls, where the horse feels confined and can easily defend. The most common types of aggression towards people are due to fear, pain, sex hormones, dominance, and learning (the horse learns that being aggressive can help it to achieve its goals). Dominance aggression and fear aggression in horses are similar to what occurs in dogs, except that equine dominance aggression does not depend on the situation as it does in dogs. Fear can be caused by physical abuse, harsh treatment, and night blindness associated with confinement in a dark stall. Horses that are aggressive to people are sometimes too dangerous to keep. There have been cases of horses killing people in such circumstances.  The first step in managing equine aggression is to ensure human safety. The cause of the aggression should then be identified and, if possible, removed. Aggressive behavior can be modified using counterconditioning and desensitization (using rewards for nonaggressive reactions). Rewards could be frequent feedings of highly desirable foods (for example, molasses or apples), attention, grooming, or exercise. The purpose of the frequent feeding is to mimic the natural pattern of frequent grazing and to associate that with the person’s presence. It is also important to examine the horse\\'s environment, making sure it has sufficient access to space, food, and water. All aggressive animals should probably be neutered because aggression may be\\xa0hereditary, and removal of sex hormones reduces some types of aggression.  Aggression toward other horses is usually associated with breeding, sexual competition, fear, dominance, and territory (including protecting the group, food, or water). Horses have preferred grooming and grazing partners. The extent to which these preferences may be a factor in aggression to other horses is unknown. Aggressive horses should be separated from other horses. To minimize competition and stress, ensure that all horses have sufficient access to space, food, water, and other resources. Treatment may include castration, desensitization, and counterconditioning. This can be done gradually by introducing horses across 1 or 2 fences so that they do not injure each other. Two fences are best because they reduce the possibility that the horses could strike each other with their feet. Medications may also be helpful in some cases. However, punishment should be avoided because it may worsen the aggression.  Maternal aggression is aggression by a mare toward people during the first few days after the delivery of a foal. It is a normal behavior caused by hormones that usually lessens with time. Allowing the mare to become familiar with her caretakers prior to delivery and minimizing human contact afterward may help. Treatment is not necessary in most cases.  Aggression while breeding can occur when stallions are overused or used out of season. Stallions can prefer certain mares and may not be compatible with the chosen mare; changing the mare may help. Stallions may not want to mate with mares that they were stabled with when they were colts, and forced mating can result in aggression. The goal of treatment is to treat the main cause of aggression; changing the mare (because of preferences) or artificial breeding can also be attempted. Physical restraint (such as hobbles) and desensitization can help as well. Clicker training has been used successfully to desensitize stallions with this problem. ## Eating Disorders Wood chewing involves grasping wood with the front teeth and then swallowing it. The usual cause of the behavior is lack of roughage in the diet. Under free-ranging or pasture circumstances, horses graze 8 to 14 hours per day, whereas confined horses eat for less than 3 to 4 hours per day. Most wood chewing occurs in the winter, and it appears to take place more often in horses that are fed pelleted diets. Confinement, lack of exercise, and boredom can also lead to wood chewing. If a horse receives less than 1 kilogram of hay per 100\\xa0kilograms of body weight, wood chewing can become extreme. It is important to address the primary problem (that is, learn why the horse is doing it), rather than merely trying to prevent it. To treat this condition the owner should provide more roughage (hay, for example), exercise (through work or increased pasture time), stimulation, toys, or social contact. Eliminating or covering exposed wood may also help.  Coprophagia is the eating of feces and is a normal behavior in foals. It is most common in the first 2 months of life, after which it usually declines. The behavior is thought to provide foals with certain nutrients and intestinal bacteria. When it is seen in adults, it is usually associated with low roughage or a dietary deficiency. A veterinarian can help identify any dietary deficiencies. Treatment usually includes increasing the amount of roughage in the diet.  Pica is the consumption of soil or sand or other nonfood items. This can lead to serious and even fatal digestive complications, and therefore should not be taken lightly. By nature, horses spend much of their time grazing and if this activity is curtailed, such as when stabled, they are likely to seek other materials to consume. Lengthy periods of confinement, often combined with concentrated feeds that are quickly consumed, can cause boredom and lead to abnormal eating behaviors. Texture may be important, and the addition of roughage, toys, and salt blocks may have a role in treatment.  Horses form friendships with other horses, and anorexia (loss of appetite) can be associated with changes in these relationships. For example, if a horse is separated from a companion it may stop eating. A submissive horse may not eat near an aggressive one that has previously attacked it. Addressing the social aspects of the problem is important. It is important to consult your veterinarian if your horse is not eating. Your veterinarian can determine whether it is a medical or behavioral issue and can prescribe drugs that stimulate appetite, if needed. In foals, poor appetite may be due to inappropriate weaning or an aggressive mare attacking a foal that tries to share the mother’s food. Barriers should be erected that safely permit normal development and feeding patterns. Foals may not eat the same plant or same plant part as the mare, and the part they choose may be based on the height of the plant. This problem should be addressed and creep feeders should be placed near the mare so that the foal does not have to choose between food and contact with its dam. Foals on pasture that are nursing do not drink water, but the mares need access to good, clean water.  Obesity can be the result of decreased exercise, increased palatable food, and understimulation (horses that eat in the absence of other activities). Food should not be abruptly removed from an obese horse. The amounts of food should be decreased gradually while increasing exercise and social contact with other horses and people. A veterinarian can evaluate the diet for nutritional content and make any necessary adjustments to achieve a more balanced ration. This will help the horse lose weight. ## Stereotypic Behaviors Stall walking or circling is a stereotypical behavior in which horses walk in circles around the stall. When released to a larger space (such as a pasture or barn), they continue to circle in a small area. Tying the horse to prevent walking will only transform the behavior into weaving (see below). Both behaviors are seen in confined horses, serve no purpose, are hard to interrupt, and are usually slower than other types of movements. Possible causes of stall walking include lack of exercise and social contact and claustrophobia (an intense fear of small spaces). Stress and anxiety appear to make the problem worse. Treatment should include increasing exercise, providing social company, allowing the horse to see other horses, and\\xa0providing clean, thick bedding. Feeding frequently (more than twice daily), allowing more access to pasture, providing more open stalls, and providing better access to outside views can also help. Adding toys to the stall may help if the horse is young and active. In some cases, your veterinarian may need to prescribe medication to control the problem.  Weaving occurs when a horse that normally stall walks is tied or prohibited from walking due to restricted space. Because they cannot circle as usual, they will still move constantly, but in a weaving motion. The horse may lift its legs, shift its weight, and move its head from side to side. Treatment includes untying the horse, providing a larger stall, or best of all, turning the horse out onto pasture. Providing a large mirror in the stall in front of the horse can help decrease weaving. The other treatments recommended for stall walking (see above) can also help.  Pawing or digging can cause injury to the horse, damage the floor, and cause wear to the horse’s hooves. It is a normal behavior when horses on winter pasture are forced to dig for feed. When horses are confined and fed highly palatable foods, pawing can occur more frequently and more intensely than it would otherwise. Pawing can occur due to frustration, anticipation, or as a displacement behavior. The underlying cause of the pawing needs to be determined in order to successfully treat it. Specific treatments are similar to those for stall walking (see above). Changing the floors to concrete may stop pawing; however, it will not change the motivation to do so, and some horses (especially stallions) may rear up instead of pawing. Pawing should not be rewarded, which is what inadvertently happens when horses paw in anticipation of feeding. The food should be presented to the horse only when the horse is not pawing, or the horse should be brought to the food.  Kicking the walls of the stall damages horses’ legs and stalls. Horses may kick due to boredom, aggression, or frustration. When it is due to aggression, kicking can occur when another horse is nearby or when the horse perceives that another horse is nearby. Kicking can also occur in anticipation of food. When the horse is then fed, the behavior is reinforced because the horse associates kicking with being fed. It may also occur when the horse cannot achieve its goals (for example, exercise or a chance to breed). It is possible that the behavior is a form of self-mutilation (see below). Many horses that kick and make holes in the walls of a stall also eat wood from these holes. For successful treatment, the underlying causes of kicking should be determined and addressed. Treatment for aggressive kicking is discussed earlier (see Aggression toward People), and for most other causes the treatment is similar to the treatment for stall walking (see above). It may also require rearranging the social grouping in the barn. Owners should never reinforce kicking by providing food when the horse kicks. Providing more social contact, exercise, and stimulation can also help.  Cribbing (windsucking, crib biting) is a distinct behavior, different from wood chewing, that involves grasping a horizontal surface (such as a fence or water bucket) with the front teeth (incisors), flexing the neck, and sucking air. Some horses swallow or breathe in the air, while others suck air without grasping any objects. The activity produces strange, nonflatulant sounds. Cribbing is associated with feeding highly palatable foods (such as grain or molasses), lack of exercise, and confinement. It is more likely to occur in Thoroughbreds, other racehorses, and dressage horses. Cribbing is most easily diagnosed by noticing the missing U‑shaped pieces from the available fencing. Horses that crib have worn teeth and develop thick neck muscles. Treatment options include increasing roughage in the diet, increasing exercise and stimulation (such as toys), changing companions, and providing greater access to pasture. Placing a strap around the horse’s neck behind the poll can help by applying pressure each time the horse tries to flex its neck. Keeping stalls free of horizontal surfaces and objects that the horse can grasp can also help minimize cribbing.  Self-mutilation occurs when a horse hurts itself by biting (usually the legs, chest, or flanks) or kicking its abdomen with its hindlegs. Some horses vocalize at the same time. It may be due to a medical problem, such as a digestive disorder (for example, colic), skin disease, or pain. Your veterinarian can help differentiate a medical problem from one that is primarily behavioral. Self-mutilation can appear in sexually frustrated (usually male) or socially incompatible horses. It can also occur as a displacement activity. The problem is more common in males less than 2 years old and may possibly be triggered by environmental stressors. Treatment should include correction of the underlying problem. Self-mutilation associated with sexual frustration can be addressed by castration, pasturing with a mare, removing all mares, increasing exercise, increasing roughage, and decreasing grain. ## Sexual Behavior Problems Stallions have poor libido (are unwilling to mate) if they are overused for breeding, are inhibited because of the use of anti-masturbation devices, are used out of season, or are injured while breeding. Masturbation is a normal equine behavior. There is no truth to the myth that masturbation depletes semen value because horses that masturbate rarely ejaculate. Stallions that have poor libido should be rested if they have been overused. Submissive stallions that are presented to aggressive mares may also be unwilling to mate. Another cause of poor libido can be a poor breeding environment. Many stallions are “picky” about the environment in which they are collected and may exhibit signs of poor libido if the environment is not right. Distractions such as yelling, rapid and unexpected movement, and rough handling can lead to a stallion that has no interest in the situation at all.  Letting a stallion that exhibits poor libido watch other stallions mate may have a beneficial effect on their libido. Using an artificial vagina or medications may also help. Providing them with a variety of mares, including \"teaser\" mares, can also stimulate their interest. Pasturing with a mare may also help. Stallions should also be well rested and fed.  Nymphomania is excessive sexual behavior that is seen in mares usually due to changes within the ovary. Nymphomaniac mares “wink” (show the clitoris), squat, and urinate frequently, often when they are not in heat. Mating behaviors and those involved in solicitation are not considered abnormal if they occur every 21 days when the mare cycles. Nymphomaniac mares should be checked for underlying medical problems. Mares that are not in heat but show sexual receptivity to males may also have psychic estrus. The treatment for nymphomania and psychic estrus depends on the cause and includes hormone medications, increasing exposure to daylight (more than 16 hours per day), or surgery.  It is common for mares to exhibit a silent heat, especially during the first estrus cycle. The ovary responds as it should for estrus (that is, the ovary produces a normal follicle and ovulates), but the mare will not accept a stallion. Causes include stress and mating preferences. It may help to present her with several stallions. If she is nursing a foal, weaning may also help.  Geldings that act like stallions will mount mares, attack foals, fight with other males, or self-mutilate. These geldings may also disturb other social relationships. Laboratory tests may be helpful to exclude underlying medical problems, although about 50% of normally castrated geldings will retain some stallion-like behavior. Treatments include separation from any targeted horses and medications. ## Foal Rejection Foal rejection is seen in 3 main forms: mares that will accept the foal but will not let it suckle, mares that are fearful of\\xa0the foal and run away, and mares that exhibit stallion-like behavior and attempt to kick or bite the foal. The first two forms are mainly seen in mares that are first-time mothers or those with a painful udder. The aggressive form may be hereditary in Arabians and Morgans. Mares may paw at\\xa0foals to stimulate them to rise from recumbency, which is different from rejection. Mares can kill their foals if they are underweight and not getting enough to eat, and this can be a normal, although uncommon behavior. The first step in treatment is to protect the foal. If the mare will accept the foal but not let it suckle, the mare should be helped through several nursings until she learns that suckling is pleasurable. Holding her in such a way that she cannot injure the foal may involve either cross-ties or partial barriers through which she can see and smell the foal but that prohibit her from reaching for it. Avoiding any disturbances while the mare is nursing the foal is essential for successful nursing. The mare should be checked to make sure there is nothing wrong with her udder, such as mastitis or sores that could be causing her pain, which can explain an aversion to nursing. Pressure in the udder resulting from infrequent nursing can be treated using warm water baths and soaks, light massage using a hose, and milking the mare.  Mares that are afraid of their foals should be treated in the same manner, but the addition of relaxation cues such as darker, quieter stalls and food treats may help. Dogs have been used to evoke maternal “herding” behavior by stimulating the mare to protect the foal from a potential threat. Mares that attempt to injure their foals must be restrained with barriers or by tying. At the same time, the mare can be\\xa0counterconditioned using positive rewards. If the mare cannot be retrained or trusted, a replacement (“nurse”) mare should be sought or other arrangements made (hand nursing) so that the foal can be adequately nourished. ## Fear and Phobia Horses can have fears and phobias. Fear is a normal response to a real or perceived threat. Phobia is an exaggerated fear response that is sudden and profound and results in panic. The two most common phobias in horses are associated with noise and location. Horses naturally have a fear of new things (called neophobia), which may be responsible for some behavior issues, such as trailer-related problems (see below). The first step in managing fears and phobias is to identify the trigger. It may help to avoid, if possible, situations in which the fear or phobia occurs. Treatment includes changing the horse\\'s emotional response to the trigger through desensitization and counterconditioning. For example, treating a noise phobia may involve playing a recording of the problematic noise at a low volume that does not evoke fear while the horse is rewarded with gentle petting or a highly desired treat. The volume of the recording can then be slowly increased over time as long as the horse remains calm. Desensitization and counterconditioning take time and patience and may require your veterinarian\\'s help. Never use punishment in response to fears or phobias because it will make the problem worse. Medications may also be necessary.  Problems with trailering include refusing to enter or leave the trailer and scrambling while traveling. Horses may be afraid to load into a trailer because of natural fears (such as fear of new things, a dark interior, instability of the trailer, or noise) and/or learned factors (such as a previous accident, motion sickness, or previous punishment while loading). A horse may load into a trailer just fine but then misbehave while inside. This could be because the horse finds it difficult to keep its balance while the trailer is moving, anticipates a stressful event (such as a race after the trailer ride), or has motion sickness. All of these problems can be potentially injurious to the horse and are best addressed early. The best longterm approach to managing trailering problems is desensitization and counterconditioning using rewards, such as treats. However, these techniques take time and must be performed long before the trailering occurs. Foals should be taught at a young age to load into a trailer with their mothers. Punishment should never be used because it will make the problem worse. Often, treatment can be as simple as backing the horse into the trailer (using a platform rather than a ramp), walking the horse slowly around and then into the trailer, or using another horse that trailers well as a “buddy.” Trailers can be designed to allow bidirectional entry and exit and a walk-through option. Walking through the trailer may help demonstrate that the horse is not walking into a dark, uncertain area. Once the horse is calm, the gate can be raised. If these techniques do not work and the horse must be transported, your veterinarian may prescribe a sedative. However, sedatives will not help the horse learn for future travel and will make them less stable during the drive. ## For More Information Also see professional content regarding behavior problems in horses.\\n\\nurl: https://www.merckvetmanual.com/all-other-pets/mice/special-considerations-for-mice\\nname: Special Considerations for Mice\\ndocument: Mice are easy to tame, handle, and look after, even by children. They are nocturnal by nature and usually spend most of the day sleeping; at night they are very active. Due to their small size, mice should be handled gently and may not be the best pet for very young children.  You can temporarily restrain a mouse by gently grasping the base of the tail and supporting its body with your other hand. Pick up a mouse by scooping it gently into a cupped hand. Avoid picking up a mouse by the tail. Owners should be careful not to drop their pet because even a short fall can be harmful—or fatal—to the mouse. Mice may bite or try to escape if they become scared when they are handled or are in unfamiliar surroundings.  Because mice are social animals that need company, it is better to keep them in a group. However, they are also very prolific breeders, so males and females should be kept in different cages. Aggression is uncommon in mice that were raised together as littermates. However, when new groups of animals are housed together, they should be watched carefully for fighting, as this may cause injuries.  Mice have limited ability to regulate their body temperature, and they are very sensitive to heat and cold. They regulate their body temperature through dilation or constriction of the veins in their tails. They should be housed in a temperature range of 64°F to 79°F (18°C to 26°C), with a humidity level of 30% to 70%. Temperatures above 86°F (30°C) can cause heat stroke, especially if the cage is overcrowded. Although good lighting is important, mice should be kept away from direct sunlight.  ## For More Information Also see professional content regarding mice as pets.\\n\\n'},\n",
